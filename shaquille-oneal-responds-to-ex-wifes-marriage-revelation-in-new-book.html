Wishing you all the best … All love, Shaq,” he wrote on Wednesday, May 8, captioning the upload, “Trust me I get it.”</p><p>Henderson and O’Neal tied the knot in 2002, separating five years later. Following a brief reconciliation in 2007, Henderson <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in 2009.</p><p>Henderson noted in her memoir that she “was in love with the idea of being married to the man I had a family with” and “was in love with the idea of building a life together.” She added, “I truly did enjoy spending time with him. [NBA] road trips gave me a chance to be with my husband and experience the NBA life for a little while.”</p><p>The exes share sons Shareef, 24, and Shaqir, 21, as well as daughters Amirah, 22, and Me’arah, 18. They also coparent Henderson’s son Myles from a previous relationship, and O’Neal shares daughter Taahirah, 27, with ex <strong>Arnetta Yardbourgh</strong>.</p><p>Henderson noted that because O’Neal was “trying to be a world-famous, thirty-something multimillionaire with thousands of women throwing themselves at him” while also “being a husband and a father,” their relationship ultimately fizzled out.</p><p>“I enjoyed those sweet early years being a mother and raising my children; my days were always busy with kids and family, and every now and then I got to travel or enjoy a little of the NBA high life,” Henderson wrote. “But invisibly, my marriage was beginning to crumble.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the wake of Henderson’s revelation, some of <a href=#>the former couple’s kids</a> took to the comments section of O’Neal’s post to share messages of support.</p><p>“Love you man! You saved my life,” Shareef wrote, while Shaqir added, “You know i love ya twin.”</p><p>O’Neal also received praise from several famous pals, including <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>. “Hey now. We all have a sociopathic ex,” Beckinsale, 50, wrote. “I got you — want me to pull up and snatch a wig or two? I will … love you man.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGmwqq4y55kqKaVlrluvsSsp6imlKh6tbuMnq9mr5mbsrR5zJqpq6GRnLJuvsSvnKWZpJ68r3nIp2Snnadir7C7ymg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-gomez-the-weeknd-make-out-on-italian-vacation-pics-w463916.html><span>←</span><span>Selena Gomez, The Weeknd Make Out on Italian Vacation: Pics</span></a>
