After the match, he pointed at Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns, clearly determined to avenge his loss at WrestleMania 39.</p><p>Rhodes came to the ring on the January 29 episode of WWE RAW and briefly commented on his win on Saturday. He then said it was time to make his match at WrestleMania official. However, World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins interrupted him. He congratulated Cody and said he had earned it. But Rollins shifted gears by saying that Rhodes would be making a mistake if he chose to face Reigns at WrestleMania.</p><p>He brought up Rhodes’ comments at the post-show press conference on Saturday, where he said he was “the guy.” Rollins said that he was the guy, not Cody or Roman reigns. He noted that it made sense for Rhodes to face Reigns last year, as Roman had both titles, but the landscape had changed. Rollins emphasized that the two of them were the ones at the house shows over the last year, and he was defending his title, whereas Reigns was not.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-seth-rollins-wonders-which-title-cody-rhodes-wants>Seth Rollins Wonders Which Title Cody Rhodes Wants</h2><p>Rollins reminded Cody that his title was created because fans were tired of Reigns’ title reign. He stated that they had leveled the playing field. Rollins told Cody that they did not need to pretend that Reigns was a god, and they did not need him at all. He then questioned which title Rhodes wanted, as he drew a stark contrast between his title and that of Reigns. Rolins said Reigns held the Hollywood title, the one for people who politic their way to the top to get.</p><p>On the other hand, his championship was the Dusty Rhodes, as it was about hard workers proving who was the best in the ring. He encouraged Rhodes to think about it, and Cody admitted that Rollins caught him by surprise, but he would think about it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Catch up on our coverage of WWE RAW <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtZ25tZGLApsDHZqmopJyeu7R5z6KrnKCVqHq4vsSsq6WdnZa7qq2Mppitm5hirqityKeqrWWTpLG6edGhpp2do2K8r3nWsJxmqpGs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./seth-rogen-tag-image-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Seth Rogen Tag Image Net Worth How Much is Seth Rogen Tag Image Worth?</span></a>
