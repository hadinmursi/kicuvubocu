But our favorite part of the interview comes when they reverse roles and the British fashionista asks RiRi about her dream wedding dress.</p><p>“It would probably be a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">collaboration</a> between myself and [John] Galliano” the 31-year-old responded. “Of course.” The “Umbrella” singer is constantly slaying every fashion moment, so we can only imagine what she and the daring designer would create for her big day.</p><p>Not to mention, it wouldn’t even be the first time the Barbados-native has worked with the designer. At the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavenly Bodies Met Gala</a> in 2018, Rihanna shut it down on the red carpet in a pope-inspired look that he created. Wintour even noted earlier in the video that this pearl-encrusted ensemble also happens to be one of her favorite Rihanna looks.</p><p></p><p>Her other one? The Guo Pei haute couture gown she wore to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">China: Through a Looking Glass Met Gala</a> in 2015. “The world will never look at yellow in the same way again,” said Wintour.</p><p>This playful video accompanies the Guava Island star’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue cover</a>, which was released on Wednesday, October 9. In the corresponding feature story, the businesswoman describes her role with the continually growing Fenty.</p><p>“I’m not the face of my brand, but I am the muse and my DNA has to run all the way through it,” she explained. “I don’t want anyone to pull up my website and think, Rihanna would never wear that.”</p><p>She explains her style is ever-changing, just like her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fenty</a> releases. While she might want to be a tomboy one day, the next she may be in a skirt and swimsuit.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But this relatability isn’t the only reason people love her. The woman is also straight-up #goals.</p><p>“She’s not telling everyone to be like her, “Jennifer Rosales, who oversees Fenty’s beauty and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> lingerie</a> operations, says. “She’s telling everyone, ‘You can feel this good too. You just gotta do you.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6e2qa3Np5hmq5GuwG6w0Z6YpmWnmrGltc2gZJ2qlajAbrDErKCgppWneqq%2FjKOmoaZdnK6tuMiapahn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./riccardo-tisci-dating-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Riccardo Tisci: dating, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</span></a>
