But there was one time where <a href=#>Fit Finlay</a> got him really good instead. At one point, Finlay placed a live rooster underneath the ring with Hornswoggle during one of the matches.</p><p>It’s clear that Hornswoggle is really tired of talking about it, but he went into it with&nbsp;Liam Alexander-Stewart of <a href=#>Inside The Ropes</a> one more time:</p><p>“Are we talking about this godd-mn chicken thing? I thought this was done,” Hornswoggle said. “I thought I was done. I told JBL I did the podcast last week. I said I thought we were over this. I wrote it in the book Life is Short and So Am I available at Amazon.com or at DylanPostl.com. I thought it was done. I really did. And then it got brought up and my Twitter, I would just get GIFS or JIFS, whatever they are called. I’m thirty-five years old. I don’t know what the hell it’s called. I thought it was done. I would just get pictures and videos of roosters and chickens. I said, guys, this is. It was one of the worst days at work of my life. They put a live rooster under the ring with me during a match while I was under there. It was like it was the absolute worst, worst I could have. I could have died. They want to kill me.”</p><p>While this rib clearly still haunts Hornswoggle to this day, he didn’t really get ribbed too many times while he was in WWE. When asked why he attributed it to being close friends with Fit Finlay, who he views as his wrestling dad:</p><p>“I think people at times were afraid to pick on me because of my relationship with Fit, like he is and will always be my dad, my wrestling dad,” Hornswoggle admitted. “I have three dads, I have my real dad, I have Fit, and I have Tommy Dreamer and I have three of the most opposite of each other dads ever. But I love it that way. So I wasn’t I wasn’t the target a lot, and if I was, it was usually by Fit, but I was always the one, like coercing others to pull them on each other. I had influence. I was 100 percent the sh-t-stirrer of the locker room, 100 percent. I’m OK with that. Again, I’m putting smiles on faces, whether it’s someone at someone else’s expense. I’m putting smiles on faces. I’m making everyone’s day better.”</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Hornswoggle Says He Has Heat With The Rock For Backstage Incident; Talks About Being Vince’s Kid, Online “Keyboard Bullies”</a></p><p>What are your thoughts on the rib Fit Finlay played on Hornswoggle?
