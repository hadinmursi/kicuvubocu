In Hollywood, it's definitely pretty common to hear about celebrities&nbsp;in this type of situation. Although that doesn't mean that fans are okay with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the case of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Disick</a> and&nbsp;Sofia Richie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their romance seemed really sweet</a> at the beginning, but the two have broken up and it has made their age gap seem even more glaring.</p><p>Of course, fans have had quite the reaction to the&nbsp;relationship between 21-year-old Richie and 37-year-old Disick. It's tough to ignore how many years are between them, and it's even harder to forget that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disick and Kourtney Kardashian were once in love</a>.</p><p>Let's take a look at the things that fans have said about this famous couple.</p><h2 id=what-fans-think>What Fans Think</h2><p>It doesn't look like Richie and Disick are the kind of Hollywood couple&nbsp;who fans treat as royalty. Nor are they eager for vacation photos and news of an engagement. Instead, fans have never really been on board with this romance. People first took notice of Richie when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was seeing Justin Bieber in 2016</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stylecaster.com</a>,&nbsp;a fan wrote an Instagram comment telling Richie, "Leave Scott alone and face your future." Richie wrote, "Leave me alone and face your future."</p><p>That isn't the only time that fans have had something to say about the two stars. When they broke up for the first time in&nbsp;June&nbsp;2018, a fan tweeted, "thank god that entire thing was freaky." Another said, "That's good she deserves better than him." Also in 2018, when Richie wore black clothing that included some athleisure, fans were upset that she was attempting to copy Kourtney Kardashian's style.</p><p>It wasn't only the clothes, though, as Sofia had also gone for a darker hair color. According to&nbsp;Teen Vogue, one fan tweeted that with Richie's darker hair, she was Kardashian's doppelganger, and they said, "it's kinda creeping me out."</p><p>The majority of fan reactions to this romance seem to be negative and people really can't move beyond the age difference. In December 2017, Disick posted a&nbsp;video of his girlfriend in her underwear, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Twitter reaction wasn't good</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A fan tweeted, "But it's weird to me to see Sofia Richie dancing around in her underwear and Scott filming her knowing she's only 4 months older than me." Another said, "the idea of Sofia Richie and Scott Disick freak me out that age gap is just too weird."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's What Sofia Richie's Life Was Like Before Scott Disick" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Sofia Richie's Life Was Like Before Scott Disick</a></span></p><h2 id=the-timeline-of-their-love-story>The Timeline Of Their Love Story</h2><p>According to&nbsp;E Online, Richie and Disick were in a relationship for three years and things ended up between them in May 2020. A source said, "Sofia thinks Scott has a lot on his plate right now and thinks it's best for them to be apart so he can focus on himself. She is only looking out for him and his best interest and it was primarily her decision for them to split." People have been talking about Disick&nbsp;going through some mental health struggles recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A source told&nbsp;Us Weekly that things have gotten tough for&nbsp;Disick recently: "He’s always had issues, especially with addiction, and that’s always been a concern on the Kardashians’ end and Sofia and her family’s end. “Sofia noticed that he wasn’t doing well and gave him an ultimatum, and in the end, it seemed like Scott was more focused on Kourtney and his kids than her.”</p><p>News of a relationship started to break in May 2017 as people saw the two stars on a yacht. By September, there were some pictures of PDA, and according to&nbsp;Cosmopolitan, they were boyfriend/girlfriend in October. Many people were surprised as she was 19 years old when they first started dating. By June 2018, they had split up for the first time as people said that he had been with&nbsp;another girl.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Little-Known Facts About Kourtney Kardashian And Scott Disick's Son, Mason" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little-Known Facts About Kourtney Kardashian And Scott Disick's Son, Mason</a></span></p><h2 id=a-change-in-tune>A Change In Tune?</h2><p>While the majority of fans have shared on social media that they think that Disick has been unfaithful to Richie, so the break-ups have never been a huge shock, one fan did say that they were wrong to doubt them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cheat Sheet&nbsp;quoted a fan who posted on Reddit: "I think she’s been good for him.
