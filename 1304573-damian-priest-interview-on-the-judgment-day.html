The legend then teased a fourth member for several weeks, and the newcomer turned out to be Finn Balor. But this four-person version of the stable was short-lived, as Priest, Balor, and Ripley immediately turned on Edge and kicked him out of the group. Since then, the faction has consisted of the trio, though “The Nightmare” has been sidelined with an injury in recent weeks.</p><p>During an interview with Phil Strum on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Under The Ring</a>, Priest discussed The Judgment Day and stated that he believes the change to the group will “work out really well.”</p><p>“This whole thing has been super cool,” said Priest. “Being a focal point of the show is never a bad thing, right. So I’ve enjoyed it a lot. I got to spend some time alongside Edge and learn from him, and now, like you said, now the group has transitioned into an all equals thing, in looking forward to it. Rhea, myself, and Finn, we have good chemistry and we get along really well, and when we talk ideas and whatnot, everything flows, like we’re always on the same page. So this is gonna be good. This is gonna work out really well for us.”</p><p>The former WWE United States Champion also emphasized the importance of the faction’s presentation. When asked about it, Priest described how the three members are often on the same page, and they collaborate on each aspect of the package.</p><p>“Well with them it’s super cool because like I said, it’s crazy how we’re on the same page all the time,” said Priest. “When we’re gonna go out there, it’s kinda like we don’t have to discuss what should we wear. It’s like, ‘We’re doing the suits, right? Like yeah that’s what I figured.’ And it’s kinda cool. And we’re big fans of the presentation, the three of us, we’re pretty much the same that way too. We think it’s really important, our gear has to be important, the lighting has to be important, the walk has to be important, everything.</p><p>“We’re very into the presentation side of things. And obviously working with the WWE, it’s cool because they’re willing to kind of work with us with that because to them, it’s also important. So the process of the way we look and just the way we’re presented, it’s one of the cooler ones that we get to here as far as The Judgment Day is concerned.”</p><p>Priest and Balor will face Rey and Dominik Mysterio on the July 4 episode of <a href=#>WWE RAW</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJpa25vY2KxornImqVmqKKesrTAjKKlrZ2iq7amw4yopWasmJp6q8HDoKSepqRisaLF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carlos-gomez-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-moves-and-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Carlos Gmez Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Moves and Net Worth</span></a>
