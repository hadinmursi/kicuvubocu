While accepting his NFL Honor award in February, the California native thanked his “fiancée” without naming her.</p><p><a href=#>Woodley confirmed</a> two weeks later that she and Rodgers had been engaged “for a while.” The<a href=#> Big Little Lies</a> alum told <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> </a>at the time that she’d never seen her fiancé play football, explaining, “We met during this whacky, whacky time and all the stadiums were closed that he was playing in. I didn’t really grow up with sports, especially American sports. It was never really on my radar. When we met, also, I knew he was a football guy, but I didn’t know like what kind of a football guy he was. And I’m still constantly learning.”</p><p>The following month, Rodgers called the actress “the best thing that’s happened” to him in the last year.</p><p>While speaking with Zenith Watches’ CEO <strong>Julien Tornare</strong> in an Instagram Live video, the quarterback <a href=#>expressed his desire to have children</a> one day. “I’m in that age group where a lot of my close friends from high school and college are fathers now and have families of their own,” the Green Bay Packers player gushed in March. “It’s maybe not in the immediate future but definitely something that I really look forward to. I’ve done a pretty good job at taking care of myself for the last 37 years and look forward to taking care of another life at some point too. I just think it’s going to be so fun.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Shailene-Woodley-and-Fiance-Aaron-Rodgers-Attend-Kentucky-Derby-With-Miles-Teller-and-More-Celebs-Feature.jpg><p>The NFL player added, “I’m really excited about that chapter whenever that comes.” He went on to call fatherhood his “next great challenge” that he’s “always dreamt about.”</p><p>Before their Kentucky Derby date, the engaged couple have made a few public appearances, from<a href=#> an Arkansas dinner date</a> in March to <a href=#>a Disneyland outing</a> in April.</p><p>Earlier this month, Woodley praised Rodgers ahead of his <a href=#>Jeopardy! </a>hosting gig. “This guy right here is super sexy, super attractive … just shaved his neck this morning, has a little man bun growing,” the Secret Life of the American Teenager said in an April 15 Instagram video. “This guy is hosting Jeopardy! tonight!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGeuaa6xGauqKeUobK6ecCaqaimXae8pbPEq6pmmaSpsq%2BwjKScp6ylmLi6ecOeqZuxXaW1sMDOaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sage-ayla-gupta-birthday-age-siblings-boyfriend-wiki-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Sage Ayla Gupta Birthday, Age, Siblings, Boyfriend, Wiki, Biography</span></a>
