In truth, <a href=#>she's amassed most of her fortune outside the music industry</a>, thanks to the incredible success of Fenty Beauty and her lingerie line Savage Fenty. Still, her vast, dedicated following stems directly from her music career.</p><p>Rihanna has definitely earned the right to treat herself and treat herself as she does. The billionaire has no problem splurging on the finer things in life. Below, we highlight some of Rihanna's most significant purchases to give insight into how the singer spends her billions.

The singer reportedly spends about $56,000 a week to maintain her gorgeous appearance. The Umbrella singer shells out all that money to ensure she has a string of experts on her beauty team at all times. This includes an on-call dermatologist, nail technician, hair stylist, and eyelash technician. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A source close to Rihanna said</a>, "Her eyelash expert is on call 24/7.

Her collection includes numerous six-figure watches, such as her yellow gold Panthère de Cartier, which retails for up to $238,000. The watch first debuted in 1983 and has been spotted on superstars like Madonna and Jane Fonda. It only makes sense that Rihanna would have one for herself. She's also the owner of a rose gold Patek Philippe Nautilus watch. The average price for that watch starts at around $150,000.</p><p>She also has a few watches that appear to be just below the six-figure mark... which is nothing to sneeze at, that's for sure. For example, the watch she was wearing during the photo shoot for her baby bump reveal was a Rolex King Midas, which according to online sources, retails for around $27,000.​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-of-her-net-worth-does-rihanna-spend-on-her-baby><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>How Much Of Her Net Worth Does Rihanna Spend On Her Baby?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rihanna-and-asap-rocky-attending-the-2021-met-gala.jpg><p>True Rihanna fans know that the singer had always dreamed of being a mother, which is why so many of them were beyond thrilled when she announced she was expecting a baby with ASAP Rocky.
