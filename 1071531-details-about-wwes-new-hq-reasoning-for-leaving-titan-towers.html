In their current setup, employees have to shift between three buildings in order to operate. This sometimes includes shuttle buses and crossing guards, a less than efficient solution during the average workday. WWE is now a global company and needs a bigger base of operations to run efficiently.</p><p>While there is a fondness for the building and what it represents, the move is seen eternally as a big stepping stone. WWE will be part of the Stanford skyline when the move is complete, and they’ll have plenty of room to spread out and breathe. Some reports even suggest that Vince McMahon’s XFL/Alpha Entertainment operations could come in house at the new HQ, although that’s not finalized at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9waG5rYWKxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjLCunqtdo7K4eceqZKudkai8r7XNoGSfp6Jiuaat1aKloGWknsGiuoytprCdoqg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-mistakens-artists-name-gayle-adams-during-eras-tour.html><span>←</span><span>Despite The Success Of The Eras Tour, Taylor Swift Felt Awful On-Stage After She Messed Up An Artist</span></a>
