Highlights Taylor Swift allegedly organized for Kanye West to be moved from his seats at the Super Bowl to avoid being overshadowed. The feud between Swift and West dates back to the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards incident and has continued over the years. Despite his attempts to disrupt Swift's spotlight, West managed to gain exposure through a low-budget advertisement during the Super Bowl.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Teresa Giudice Makes a Spicy Skinny Italian Dish</h2><time>Aug 22, 2024</time>

Conway Twitty. Given True Detective’s penchant for teasing out legendary tales, it’s fitting that a king (or, rather, the shadow of one) hovers over the second season’s third episode. It opens with what appears to be an Elvis impersonator (played by Jake La Botz) decked out in a shimmering powder-blue suit. He’s on his knees, pomaded hair slicked back, hamming it up onstage at Ray Velcoro’s local dive bar, not by lip-synching an Elvis tune but “The Rose,” a Conway Twitty cover first made famous by Bette Midler.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>This Drag Race All Stars Lip Sync Got SICKENING</h2><time>Aug 22, 2024</time>

RuPaul’s Drag Race fanatics have o-fficially been fed. In the third episode of this sixth All Stars season, which premiered yesterday on Paramount+ (yes, us live-tweeters and memers are still pleading … Why?), legendary lip-sync assassin Trinity K.

Hit Man. Anybody up for a movie? The Toronto International Film Festival, trapped in the stalemate precipitated by the AMPTP’s questionable refusal to make a deal with Hollywood’s unions, opened this year with more films for sale than ever, per The Wrap. A total of 50 movies were available for acquisition deals at the start of the festival. Unfortunately for film sales, the buying aspect of it all is moving at a snail’s pace.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tony Resslers Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</h2><time>Aug 22, 2024</time>
