He is the 8-times Guinness World Record holder for the largest wave ever surfed, part of the only team to have ever surfed waves generated by a 300ft calving glacier in Alaska, and the only foreigner to receive the Vasco de Gama Medal of Honor from the Portuguese Navy for his contribution to Portugal.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=garrett-mcnamara-age></span> Garrett McNamara Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born on August 10, 1967 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=garrett-mcnamara-family></span> Garrett McNamara Family<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Garrett McNamara was born to Malia McNamara and Laurence McNamara in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on August 10, 1967. He has a brother, Liam. His mom, Malia, fled with the infant McNamara from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and moved to Berkeley, California, where her marriage ended.</p><p>She embarked on a jornery, settling for periods of time in communes and cults. They moved to as far as Central America. 5-year-old McNamara witnessed his mother being kicked in the head by her enraged partner until she was bloody and unconscious. Her abuser was Luis, whom Garrett’s mother met on a road trip to Honduras, according to a&nbsp;Smithsonian magazine profile.</p><p>Every so often his mother abandoned Garrett, leaving him with strangers. In Guatemala a peasant farmer, recognizing the neglect, begged to adopt him. Garrett was willing but his mother brought him back on the road.</p><p>She continued to take him on her journeys, and at age 7 they were begging for food and eating out of dumpsters in California. McNamara’s mother left the boy in Berkeley with his birth father and he became a committed skateboarder. After a few years, Garrett’s mother reappeared out of the blue and reclaimed him. She had a new partner, Darryl, a small and younger black lounge singer.</p><p>“My mother married this guy, his name was Darryl. And he was moving us to Hawaii. And he was a musician. He was working with Don Ho’s daughter, actually,” McNamara told WBUR. “And then he ended up meeting some girl, left my mom, and me and my mother and brother were stuck in Waialua at Cement City. It was pretty much the armpit of Oahu.” McNamara and his family went on welfare.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=garrett-mcnamara-first-wife></span> Garrett Mcnamara First Wife<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Who is Garrett McNamara’s first wife? Surfer Garrett McNamara married his first wife Connie in 1994. In 1995, he and his wife Connie became parents. McNamara opened a surf shop in Oahu to help support his family.&nbsp;He struggled with the idea of having one foot on his surfboard, and one in the shop. “So now I was at a crossroad,” he told WBUR. “I thought, ‘Why am I doing this?’”</p><p>Over the next six years, McNamara didn’t surf very much. During long days indoors, he daydreamed. He’d scribble inspirational notes in his business log and gaze longingly at the ocean on his drive to work. At the age of 35, McNamara entered and trained for the 2002 Pe’ahi Challenge on Maui, also known as “Jaws” for its dangerous 70-foot waves. He won the contest and pocketed the $70,000 first prize. He closed the shop and focused on “tow-in” surfing, where Jet Skis pull surfers to the peaks of fast-moving big waves. It is unclear how his first marriage ended. His marriage ended and McNamara fell in love again with Nicole.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=garrett-mcnamara-wife></span> Garrett McNamara Wife<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>McNamara is married to his second wife, Nicole McNamara, an environmental sciences teacher.

McNamara and his wife, Nicole, have two children, Barrel who was born in 2015 and Theia Love Nazaré Celeste Rose who was born in 2018.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=garrett-mcnamara-height-and-weight></span> Garrett McNamara Height and&nbsp;Weight<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He stands at a height of 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) and weighs 175 lb (79 kg).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=garrett-mcnamara-net-worth></span> Garrett McNamara Net Worth<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Surfer Garrett McNamara’s net worth is estimated to be $5 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=garrett-mcnamara-instagram></span> Garrett McNamara Instagram<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BRp7%2BmwNNmpJymkaKus62MsKCfnV2WtKZ5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecWapKKkqWK1prXGoatmmpmkeri1yqJkqZmimru1v4ykoJ2rXZu2s7%2FTZq6inpViwLa%2BxZ6pZqGeqMGis9GapGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./garazi-urkola-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-69017-html.html><span>←</span><span>Garazi Urkola Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
