Staff members at Church’s bar also claimed that Wallen threw the chair from six stories high, <a href=# rel=noopener>News Channel 5 Nashville</a> reported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Morgan-Wallen-MugShot.jpg><p>Police officers later viewed a video that showed Wallen “lunging and throwing an object over the roof,” per the arrest report, which noted that the singer laughed off the incident. His bond was set at $15,250. (Wallen is set to appear in court on Friday, May 3.)</p><p>Wallen has experienced a slew of ups and downs throughout his career. The singer experienced a run-in with law enforcement in May 2020 when he was arrested outside of Kid Rock’s Nashville bar, Big Honky Tonk, for public intoxication and disorderly conduct. While he was later cleared of all the charges, Wallen continued to make headlines.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In February 2021, a video of Wallen <a href=#>using the N-word</a> was shared online. The musician received major backlash and was faced with various consequences within the country music community.</p><p>“I’m long overdue to make a statement regarding my last incident. I wanted to collect my thoughts, seek some real guidance and come to you with a complete thought before I did,” Wallen later said in an apology video, revealing he had spoken with the Nashville chapter of the NAACP. “They had every right to step on my neck while I was down, to not show me any grace. But they did the exact opposite — they offered me grace, and they also paired that with an offer to learn and to grow.”</p><p>Despite the scandal, Wallen’s career is still on the rise. He hit the road on his <a href=#>One Night at a Time Tour</a> earlier this month. He was nominated for Male Video of the Year for his song “Last Night (One Record At A Time Sessions)” at Sunday’s awards show in Austin, Texas, but <strong>Jelly Roll</strong> took home the win for “Need A Favor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamp6Kcrq951pqjpZ2eYq6zvsSsq56cXZu8s3nApaOen5WZubp506GpqK%2BZo7Rur8eaoKtlkal6r63Soa2ipJyaeqOt0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./715211-mma-journalist-ariel-helwani-thrown-out-of-ufc-199-tonight-banned-for-life-after-breaking-original-brock-lesnar-story.html><span>←</span><span>MMA Journalist Ariel Helwani Thrown Out of UFC 199 Tonight &amp;amp; Banned For Life After Breaking Original</span></a>
