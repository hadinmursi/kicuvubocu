I remember the first table read, how good he was.” John Corbett, who played furniture hottie Aidan Shaw, was also not Star’s first pick. “We initially were thinking about Aidan Quinn for Aidan, but I think he wasn’t available,” said Star. “I loved John Corbett in <i>Northern Exposure</i>, and we were like, ‘Well, what’s John Corbett been up to?’ He just had the laconic, dudish vibe. But we kept ‘Aidan’ because we loved the name.” It all worked out: Alec Baldwin went on to do <i>30 Rock</i>, and Chris Noth stamped himself in our hearts as Mr. Big. He’s like the Chrysler Building.
