It becomes a haunting memory. The same is true for when we lose a celebrity that meant a lot to us. Who can't recall that gut-punch when Robin Williams passed? Or Alan Rickman? Or Betty White? As for Bob Saget, it's clearly not just co-stars, <a href=#>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who grieve his loss</a>, it's everyone who has been touched by his raunchy stand-up, his heartfelt performance on Full House, or his charismatic hosting of America's Funniest Home Videos. As fans mourn Bob after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his tragic and sudden death</a>, an array of eulogies have been shared by those who knew Bob best. Among them, radio legend <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like us, Howard Stern will remember how he found out that Bob Saget died. Although, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his touching tribute on The Stern Show</a> On January 11th, 2022, another celebrity told him. It was Train frontman Pat Monahan who reached out to Howard to let him know. Of course, Howard admitted to being very sad. After all, Bob has appeared on his iconic radio show more than 10 times. Here's the truth about the relationship between the two comedy legends...</p><h2 id=howard-stern-saw-a-side-to-bob-saget-that-most-fans-didn-39-t-see>Howard Stern Saw A Side To Bob Saget That Most Fans Didn't See</h2><p>There was a time when Bob Saget was a regular guest on The Howard Stern Show. This was during the tail end of Howard's raunchiest chapter as a radio shock jock. With friends like Norm Macdonald and <a href=#>former Stern Show co-host Artie Lange</a>, Bob found himself at home on the show. The two would often talk about Bob's divorce from his first wife, Sherri Kramer, and what a ladies' man he'd become. In Howard's January 11th tribute, he claimed that the first woman on Bob's arm after his divorce was from the Playboy Mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Bob was a divorced guy. I remember Bob came up to me and said, 'It's terrible. Divorce is terrible'. Then I think he was in the corner humping the Playboy model," Howard laughed.</p><p>During Bob's first appearance in 1998, Howard pointed out that he had heard Bob had 'fooled around' in his marriage, acting like the opposite of the character he portrayed on television. Bob immediately admitted that the rumors were right and that he acted like "an idiot".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Howard shed light on the side of Bob Saget that comedy lovers are well aware of but fans of Full House and America's Funniest Home Videos likely weren't. Howard claimed that he respected what Bob did on those two shows but wasn't necessarily a fan of them. His comedy, however, was a different story. More importantly, Howard genuinely liked Bob as a person and got to hang out with him through The Stern Show and their mutual friendship with Jimmy Kimmel as John Stamos.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Howard Stern's Relationship With John Stamos</a></span></p><p>During his Stern Show tribute, Howard read John Stamos' tribute to his Full House co-star. He was notably touched and worried about his friend John, who Howard has admitted to being quite close to. His longtime co-host, Robin Quivers, also commented on John's relationship with Bob Saget as she too got to spend time with them both.</p><p>"I liked Bob. Very nice guy," Howard said. "The few times I got to hang out with him, so to speak, [he was] just lovely."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Howard Stern And Journey's Steve Perry Absolutely Hate Each Other</a></span></p><p>While it's clear that Howard was as close of a friend to Bob as John or even Jimmy Kimmel were, he did get to see sides of the iconic comedian and actor that many of his biggest fans simply didn't. And while many of these sides were more controversial than one might expect, Howard deeply liked the man.</p><h2 id=bob-saget-39-s-death-has-got-howard-worried>Bob Saget's Death Has Got Howard Worried</h2><p>Howard Stern doesn't need any excuse to be worried about his health or his eventual demise. He's just that kind of guy. But the fact that Bob passed away so young has hit Howard hard.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Howard Stern Almost Hooked Up With Joan Rivers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's just very depressing. Like that's not a guy who is supposed to be dead," Howard said before wondering how he died (at the time of this writing, the cause of death is still unclear). The radio legend speculated as others have, that Bob passed after suffering from a heart attack, or even from a COVID relapse, in his hotel room. "Now, of course, in my mind, I'm thinking I'm dying. I was just taking a p*ss during the commercial break and I [was thinking to] myself, now I was dying. I dunno. I had thirty scenarios going. It's very depressing."</p><p>A sudden and tragic death like Bob's affects people differently. But there's no doubt that it has hit Howard who has described his feelings as truly "shocked."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Howard Stern Ripped On These Celebs Who Later Became His Friends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9OeqadlkqSvbr%2FAoJytZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./house-of-cards-season-2-premiere-spoiler-gif-html.html><span>←</span><span>Here Is a GIF of That Shocking Thing That Happened on House of Cards Season 2 Premiere</span></a>
