The most demanding, tiny boss a gal could ever have. It’s wild. No one has ever liked my boobs this much in my life.”</p><p><a href=#>Carrie Fisher</a>’s daughter <a href=#>kept her pregnancy under wraps</a> before debuting her and her fiancé <strong>Austen Rydell</strong>’s baby boy last month. “Introducing: Kingston Fisher Lourd Rydell,” Lourd wrote via Instagram in September.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He’s finally here! So happy for you! Boy moms!”<a href=#><strong> Lea Michele</strong></a> commented on the photo of the infant’s feet, while <a href=#><strong>Emma Roberts</strong></a> wrote, “Screaming!!! Love you guys so much.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Glee</a> alum, 34, <a href=#>welcomed her son, Ever</a>, in August, while Roberts, 29, is <a href=#>pregnant</a> with her and<a href=#><strong> Garrett Hedlund</strong></a>’s first child, a son. The Unfabulous alum told<strong> Jess Cagle</strong> earlier this month that her and <a href=#>her former costars’ perfect pregnancy timing</a> was “pure witchcraft.”</p><p>The Holidate star explained at the time, “I don’t know how else to explain it. It was not planned. It’s been really amazing to have support being pregnant during this time and to have it be people I’m so close to. It’s been amazing. We couldn’t have planned it better, honestly. I would be scared if we all had girls, it would be mini Scream Queens. I don’t think the world’s ready for that. So I’m grateful that we were all given boys, although who knows, they could be Scream Queens. We don’t know yet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaboZyhtqZ5y6isq5xdqLWww9Jmp6irpKWus8DUpmSbp5SuenJ5zKilraBdlrO1sdFmqqimo2Kus77Ir5ilZaCesHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelor-nation-sex-confessions-from-nick-v-to-hannah-b.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelor Nation Sex Confessions: From Nick V. to Hannah B.</span></a>
