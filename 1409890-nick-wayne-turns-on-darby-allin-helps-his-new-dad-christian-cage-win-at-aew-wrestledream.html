At AEW WrestleDream, Darby Allin challenged Christian Cage for the TNT Championship in a Two Out of Three Falls Match. The two stars headlined the show, and Allin took a remarkable amount of punishment. Allin won the first fall by pulling Cage’s turtleneck over his eyes and stacking him up for the pin.

He hit a Coffin Drop, and Cage took out the referee with an inadvertent Spear. Nick Wayne took the TNT Championship from Cage and blasted Allin with it. Cage then pinned Allin to clinch the win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>After the bell, Wayne and Cage beat up Allin. Sting tried to make the save, but he was outnumbered when Luchasaurus got involved. The lights went out, and eventually Adam Copeland, formerly known as Edge, came out. After teasing that he was on Cage’s side, he fought off Wayne and Luchasaurus. Copeland then stood tall with Allin and Sting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Catch up on our coverage of AEW WrestleDream <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNpcHFxYGK7qq%2FKZq6asZ6aerXB0aeqZqeeYrGivsGyZJqknJ67brTEpaesZZiewG66xLBknZmUYrCpvsisq6KZnmKworPEZq6ipl2WwW6txLBksKqVqMGtscOrnJql</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nemanja-vidic-bio-age-wife-brother-height-goals-stats-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nemanja Vidic Bio, Age, Wife, Brother, Height, Goals, Stats, and Net Worth</span></a>
