Kate, for instance, was upset that the couple didn’t bring her gifts for the Easter holiday one year, and also insisted that she was “owed an apology” after Meghan mentioned her post-baby mind-set in a private conversation. “We’re not close enough for you to talk about my hormones!” Kate told Meghan in front of their spouses, Harry writes. Prior to that, Kate voiced several “problems” she had with the arrangements for Meghan and Harry’s wedding, which he chalks up to American versus British cultural differences. Oh yeah, and Kate (with William) allegedly encouraged Harry to wear a Nazi uniform to a mid-aughts costume party.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcs5eg5v001f3b6v5gsa0wb9@published data-word-count=5>Sickest burn: “She loved clothes.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcs5eg8l001g3b6vuffsq2t2@published data-word-count=95><strong>Winner: Friends</strong><br>Harry, who identifies as a Chandler, mentions his “fanatic” love of the NBC sitcom four times in the book. “I think I watched every episode of <a href=#>Friends</a> in 2013,” he writes. He cites “The One With Monica and Chandler’s Wedding” as a particularly good underwear-folding episode. He would go on to be a guest at Courteney Cox’s home in Los Angeles in 2016: “The idea of crashing at Monica’s was highly appealing. And amusing.” While there he took magic mushrooms — a “trip” that crescendoed with a talking toilet that had its own head.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcs5egfo001h3b6v3ujdkys4@published data-word-count=143><strong>Loser: King Charles</strong><br>Harry accuses <a href=#>his father</a> of being complicit in enabling Camilla’s fixation with the press, so much so that William and Kate thought they were being “trapped and unfairly persecuted” by the couple. “Pa and Camilla didn’t want Willy and Kate drawing headlines away from them or their causes,” Harry writes. “They’d openly scolded Willy about it many times.” Charles was also “furious” with Harry’s crusade against the racist tabloid coverage surrounding Meghan, because it made him “look bad” that he didn’t do such an action for Camilla. “What he couldn’t really stomach was someone new dominating the monarchy,” Harry continues, “grabbing the limelight, someone shiny and new coming in and overshadowing him.” Without warning, he cut Harry off financially when the couple were left with few resources in early 2020, a decision his son says made him “fatted for the slaughter.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcs5eggw001i3b6vdt1p4mc9@published data-word-count=22>Sickest burn: “He wasn’t great at showing emotions under normal circumstances, how could he be expected to show them in a crisis?”</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcs5egj0001j3b6viaobtkhv@published data-word-count=52><strong>Winner: Will Arnett</strong><br>Harry was so starstruck meeting the voice of Batman in <a href=#>The Lego Batman Movie</a>, that he repeatedly asked Arnett to say “Hello, Harry” to him at a party. “He wanted to say no, but he didn’t want to be impolite,” Harry remembers. “Or else he recognized that I wouldn’t stop.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcs5egl6001k3b6vrkyipwhi@published data-word-count=102><strong>Loser: Prince William</strong><br>In 2019<strong>, </strong><a href=#>William</a> allegedly physically attacked Harry during an argument about Meghan, who William thought was “difficult,” “rude,” and “abrasive” — and whom he previously pleaded with his brother not to date. The attack left Harry with scrapes and bruises on his back. William appeared to be most susceptible among the Windsors to believing tabloid stories about Meghan, with Harry recalling that “he was just repeating the press narrative, spouting fake stories he’d read or been told.” He also told Harry that his therapist was brainwashing him, which Harry believes was William’s strategy to discredit Harry’s wellness among the family.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcs5egmc001l3b6vnvfyczrt@published data-word-count=13>Sickest burn: “My dear brother, my archenemy, how did we come to this?”</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcs5egnm001m3b6vythzgxob@published data-word-count=55><strong>Winner: Suits</strong><br>When Harry first told William and Kate about his romantic relationship with Meghan, they responded with genuine shock and delight.
