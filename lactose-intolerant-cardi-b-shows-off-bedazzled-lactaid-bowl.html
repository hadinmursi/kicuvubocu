The bedazzled dish was apparently sent to the “I Like It” singer by Lactaid – a brand of milk that is made without lactose, the sugar that causes stomach pain for those whose bodies can’t properly digest it.</p><p>The company apparently took notice of Cardi’s devotion and gave her the unique piece of glassware as a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>. It features white crystals around the outside, and “Lactaid” is written across the front using dark blue stones. “Look what they sent me,” the Love & Hip Hop: New York alum says in an Instagram video while giving her crystal-covered bowl a spin. “You know I made it when they sent me a motherf–ing bedazzled bowl of cereal.”</p><p>Earlier in her video clip, Cardi explained the origins of her issues with lactose. “Bitch let me motherf–ing tell you how I can’t drink whole milk no more,” she began as she held the shiny bowl in one hand, later confirming that she is lactose intolerant. According to the 26-year-old, when she does drink whole milk she has “diarrhea for three days motherf–ing straight” and is “farting up a storm.”</p><p>The stomach issues have apparently led the recent Grammy winner to make some dietary changes. “It’s just not working out,” Cardi added of her relationship with lactose. “I feel like after you turn like, 22, your body starts motherf–ing changing, so you know I drink Lactaid milk.”</p><p>Aside from the glistening adornment, Cardi makes it clear she’s also a fan of the dish itself. “This is the perfect bowl,” she declares. “There’s not too much cereal, not too much milk, [it’s] balanced well.”</p><p>After singing the bowl’s praises, the “Bodak Yellow” rapper declared: “Bitch I’m poppin.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Look at my bowl of cereal,” Cardi concluded. “You hoes ain’t eating your Honey Bunches of Oats like this!”</p><p>The bedazzled bowl is just the latest food-related gift Cardi has received since making it big. In July 2018, Chipotle gave the Bronx native <a href=#>free chips and guacamole for life</a> after she name-dropped the Mexican chain in her rap on the <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> song, “Dinero.”</p><p>“We love surprising and delighting our fans, famous or not famous, when we see the right opportunity to make their day in a genuine way,” a rep for Chipotle told Us at the time. “So, when we heard Cardi B’s lyrics in the song ‘Dinero’ about just wanting that chips, guac and queso, it obviously resonated with us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqWZk6m8tLGMoqWtp5yav6K602aamqqUnnqjedKhprCrXaSzp3nBnpuasqqhsqV5y5qarZmZmXqju9alZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenzo-kash-hart-bio-wiki-age-height-family-parents-star-kid-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kenzo Kash Hart Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Parents, Star kid and Net worth</span></a>
