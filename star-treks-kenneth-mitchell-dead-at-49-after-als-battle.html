And in truest Ken fashion, he managed to rise above each one with grace and commitment to living a full and joyous life in each moment,” the obituary added. “He lived by the principles that each day is a gift and that we never walk alone. His life is a shining example of how full one can be when you live with love, compassion, humor, inclusion and community.”</p><p class=p1>Kenneth continued to act after receiving his diagnosis.</p><p class=p1>“Working on<i> Lower Decks </i>is the last time I remember walking before having to be in a motorized wheelchair,” he previously told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>SyFy Wire </i></a>in 2020 of the <i>Star Treks </i>spinoff. “I remember walking up the stairs to go into the studio and the recording booth, and I remember having a great time with [showrunner] <strong>Mike [McMahan]</strong> and the team. And then I remember walking down the stairs but having trouble getting down. But, to be honest, that’s my last memory of walking on my own.
