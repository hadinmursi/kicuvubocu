One thing I admire about pop stars is their ability to belt their lungs out and perform intricate dance routines in front of millions of people — all while looking absolutely perfect. Seriously, it doesn’t even look like many of them break a sweat, and I’m not just talking about Taylor Swift, either."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Seriously, it doesn’t even look like many of them break a sweat, and I’m not just talking about <strong>Taylor</strong> <strong>Swift</strong>, either. <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a> (who happens to be an opener on Miss Swift’s tour) also always looks flawless at the end of her intense sets. How does she do it?</p><p>Well, the “Nonsense” singer recently revealed her makeup “essential-essential-essentials” in a TikTok video posted by <a href=# rel=noopener aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message>Who What Wear.</a> While she shares a few favorites, there’s one “magical” product she swears by to instantly banish oil and shine and keep her makeup looking good as new: the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nudestix Blot & Blur Matte Stick</a>.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nudestix Blot & Blur Matte Stick</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> at Revolve!</strong></p><p>“I can’t believe I’m telling anyone about this right now, but I’m gonna do it for the betterment of mankind,” the Girl Meets World alum joked. “It’s like my favorite thing in the world and basically replaces powder.” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The travel-friendly multi-stick</a> can be used in a few ways to mattify skin and blot oil. First, you can swipe it over bare skin to minimize the look of pores and blur imperfections before applying makeup. However, you can also use it over&nbsp;makeup to sop up excess oil without making your complexion products look cakey.</p><p>“When I’m out with my friends and they’re like ‘Oh my god, I’m so shiny and I don’t have powder,’ <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">I just put this little balmy stick</a> wherever they’re oily, and it doesn’t look powdery or cakey,” Carpenter shared. “It just looks like all the oil is gone, so it’s pretty magical.”</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This handy stick</a> is formulated to efficiently dispel oil thanks to the clean formula that contains Jeju Island volcanic ash, an oil-absorbing mineral. It also contains mugwort extract, heartleaf extract and vitamin E to clarify and soothe skin, so it leaves you with a comfortably soft complexion. In fact, if you use it regularly, these actives could help soothe blemishes and irritation, getting you one step closer to the skin of your dreams.</p><p>If you tend to get oily throughout the day, the convenient stick format makes it easy to store in your purse for touch-ups on the go. Plus, it’s much more accessible than carrying a loose powder around and less wasteful than blotting papers. Essentially, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">using this is better for mankind</a> (and the environment)!</p><p>Thank you to Carpenter for not gatekeeping this product. Now, hurry and grab your own before it sells out . . . again!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nudestix Blot & Blur Matte Stick</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> at Revolve!</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOrJibqpmjrm6vwKunnqakmr9uutSdnKysma16rq3TrZxmq6SesKx7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./romina-puga-wiki-age-married-husband-miguel-tamayo-yoga-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Romina Puga Wiki, Age, Married, Husband Miguel Tamayo, Yoga, Instagram</span></a>
