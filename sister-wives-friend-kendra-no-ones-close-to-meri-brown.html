The only reason that you guys are seeing&nbsp;Meri&nbsp;is because she’s on a TV contract,” Kendra exclusively told Us Weekly. “Meri&nbsp;has been out of the picture. Nobody is close to&nbsp;Meri.&nbsp;Meri&nbsp;has her own world, her own circle of friends. She doesn’t even live by that, I would call it, the moral code anymore of her faith. She’s very open and honest about it. She doesn’t hide it. There’s <a href=#>no secrets out there</a>. She doesn’t care. She’s an open book.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sister-Wives-Family-Friend-Claims-No-Ones-Close-Meri-Brown-001.jpg><p>Despite <a href=#>Meri’s separate existence from Kody</a>, 52, and the rest of the family, she seems to remain optimistic about reconnecting with her husband. “The only thing she’s still hanging on [to] is the fact that she loves Kody and they may, at some point, have something they don’t,” Kendra claimed. “That is long dead, and yes, she created that for herself.”</p><p>Kendra, who is close friends with <a href=#><strong>Robyn Brown</strong></a>, confirmed that Kody and Meri, 50, no longer have much in-person contact. “They don’t see each other anymore. They only see each other for, like, basically filming purposes or, I mean, maybe a holiday. I’m saying maybe because it’s not even a thing,” she alleged. “Over the past year, definitely not even 100 percent because of COVID. There’s no relationship at all. He does not trust her. He <a href=#>doesn’t want to be in a relationship with her</a>.”</p><p>Kendra believes <a href=#>Meri’s standing in the family</a> is her own fault. “I’ve witnessed her behavior in person. I’ve witnessed her moodiness and hatefulness and, like, jealousy — like, deep-rooted jealousy. And she has no accountability for that,” she told Us. “She instead allows herself to be put on a pedestal. … Everyone thinks poor&nbsp;Meri, poor Meri, poor Meri. They don’t take for a minute to pay attention to how she possibly treats people because they don’t show it at all. … I don’t think she makes herself available for any of that. I think she’s very stubborn. As a matter of fact, I know she’s very stubborn. She’s not going to let certain things be filmed. She won’t go into that, and she’ll <a href=#>just knock them</a>. She’ll be like, ‘Sorry, I’m not doing that.’ It’s made it really hard for that family.”</p><p>Meri admitted during a February episode of Sister Wives that she thought <a href=#>her marriage to Kody was “dead” and “over.”</a> She later told Us her comments were “taken out of context.” Although she noted she is “at peace” with where they stand today, she confessed: “Any <a href=#>improvement that we can make on the relationship</a> between me and him, I think it would be great.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for Kody, he told Us in February that he did not think it was his place to suggest divorce. “I feel like [my wives] need to understand that — that they <a href=#>can leave</a>,” he said. “If it’s not working for them, they can leave. Nobody’s going to be a prisoner here.”</p><p>Sister Wives airs on TLC Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoaOpsrN51qKtnqtdm7%2Bqsc2dZKSdnpm%2FonnNqGSoppWoeqS4zqycZqyfYrqmvshmmaunp6N8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shorty-da-prince-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Shorty da Prince Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
