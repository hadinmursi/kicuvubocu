I figured I’d better share it publicly,” she told Cooper.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following her heartbreaking 2010 miscarriage, Ling admitted to <a href=#>More magazine</a> that she and Song would have a child through any means necessary. “It is definitely scary. Especially when you aren’t successful, it is difficult to try again,” she told More, explaining that she and Song were both open to adoption. “We are going to try. We both have so many great experiences we would love to share with either a biological or an adopted child.”</p><p>Ling’s sister, <strong>Laura</strong>, who was held in North Korean captivity in 2009, welcomed her first child — a daughter — in 2010. She named the girl Li Jefferson Clayton, after her sister and <strong>President Clinton</strong>, both of whom appealed for her release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaloaOWeq21zaBkqaqVnLuiutNmrqKsmGKzqr7SrWScoJmhsW6tjKCgq6RdZ31yfpFtaGln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leslie-hernandez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-643077-html.html><span>←</span><span>Leslie Hernandez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
