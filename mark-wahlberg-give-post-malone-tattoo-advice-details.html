I’ve taken all mine off already.”</p><p dir=ltr>The father of four used to have several tattoos, two notable ones being a giant shoulder tattoo that said “Wahlberg” and a statement-making rosary bead necklace design that took up a solid amount of space on his chest. In 2012, he began the long and painful process of removing his permanent ink.</p><p dir=ltr>In an interview with&nbsp;Today&nbsp;that same year, Wahlberg admitted that he doesn’t want his children getting tattoos. To try and convince two of them to stay away from the tattoo parlor, he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Matt Lauer</strong></a>, “I’ve taken my two older kids to the procedure so they see how painful it is and what I have to go through.”</p><p dir=ltr>But, unlike Wahlberg’s now-traumatized children, Post Malone doesn’t appear to have any interest in slowing down his tattoo game. He has over 50 designs, his latest being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gauntlet face tattoo</a>, revealed at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve celebration on the evening of December 31.</p><p dir=ltr>Believe it or not, the 24-year-old wasn’t always obsessed with tattoos. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Justin Bieber</strong> </a>was the reason why Post Malone got his first-ever design.</p><p dir=ltr>The “Sunflower” singer opened up about his first tattoo experience on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon in 2018.&nbsp;He said, “We were working on&nbsp;Stoney&nbsp;and then we had a tattoo artist come through, and I was like, ‘You know what? Justin Bieber’s got some tats, and I love you, but I know I’m way tougher than you.”</p><p dir=ltr>Ever since then, Post Malone’s gone under the tattoo gun time and time again.</p><p dir=ltr>Wahlberg isn’t the only star to open up about how painful tattoo removal is. On Tuesday, February 25, <strong>Tallulah Willis</strong> revealed that she’s in the process of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">getting rid of one of her designs</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr>“TATTOOS R FUN UNTIL THEY’RE NOT ~~~ thankful that magic erasers for skeen exist @laseraway,” the actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned a selfie</a>, sporting a large bandage on her arm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Kus7eMsJihpJKav6h5xqKtnmWgpMC1ecyao6imlWLBosDTqKZmmZSrtqSxjJ2crZmZocBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maritess-trosper-bio-who-is-her-boyfriend-maritess-trosper-age-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Maritess Trosper Bio, Who Is Her Boyfriend?
