MEY Designs, a new jewelry line created by <i>Game of Thrones’ </i>costume designer <b>Michele Clapton</b> and London jewelers Yunus & Eliza, offers a line of premium jewelry inspired by the show’s resident queen: Daenerys Targaryen, also known as the Khaleesi. The trio have crafted a 26-piece sterling silver line that includes products worn on the show as well.</p><p>“The pieces reflect [Daenerys’] character — bold, rebellious, beautiful,” Clapton told <a href=#>Pret-a-Reporter</a>. “There are everyday pieces inspired by [the show] for adding a hint of Khaleesi rebellion to every day.”</p><span class=caption></span><p><b>Yunus Ascott</b> and <b>Eliza Higginbottom</b>, who have also made jewelry that <b>Madonna</b> has worn, revealed that fan response drove the design process too. “We have had such an amazing response to the dragon neck sculpture we made with Michele for Khaleesi, it has become iconic, with fans contacting us daily from around the world,” the duo added. “Finally being able to own it is going to&nbsp;make a lot of people very happy!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/meyforgot_dragonstone-pendant_blue-labradorite_1-1700x1699-4a421193-f07d-4cc7-94ab-f793ae96b594.jpg><p>Daenerys is a worthy muse. The queen, played by <b>Emilia Clarke</b>, is “a character that sort of appeals to both men and women. They’re both drawn to her. She’s so beautiful, and yet complicated and dynamic. She just seemed to be the perfect vehicle to launch the collection around.”</p><p>Although the series is based in a fantasy world, the pieces work for real-life women too. “I think that in the collection we have these huge statement pieces that can be worn many ways. They can be dressed up with&nbsp;evening wear. Or they can be worn in an edgy way with attitude and strength. That’s the&nbsp;way that I’d like to see them, as we have in the pictures. We’ve also made some understated pieces for people that don’t want to shout about them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To shop MEY’s <i>Game of Thrones</i> collection, visit <a href=#>Mey.London</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6y1pr7EZquoZZaeu6V5xpqknmWfm3q1tNGopZ6rXZ%2ByuLHLq7BmoqWowW64yKScZqyYmnqstMClnJ6rmah6uH6Qa2lsaF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whats-al-pacinos-real-name.html><span>←</span><span>Whats Al Pacinos Real Name?</span></a>
