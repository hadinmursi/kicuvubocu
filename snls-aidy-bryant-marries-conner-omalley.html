So, a lot of the shimmer and shine has faded and we’re just living every damn day as best we can,” Bryant told Meyers about her relationship. “We’ve seen each other through a lot. Like, he used to work as a full-blown garbage man — not a joke, just a garbage man. I used to sweep up hair in a barber shop. I mean, we’ve, like, been through it.”</p><p>Bryant also detailed how the former SNL writer proposed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I had my <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a> and our mail and all these boxes, and I walked to our door and our dog had a bow tie on. I was like, ‘My dog doesn’t wear a bow tie! Where is he going tonight?’ Basically, the second I shut the door, a man — who I discovered was Conner — frantically came around the corner and was just like, ‘Will you marry me?!’” Bryant explained at the time. “No box. No ‘I love you.’ Just a man in full terror standing very far from a dog in a bow tie, just holding a loose ring going, ‘Will you marry me?!’ I was like, ‘What?!’ I truly couldn’t comprehend what was happening, and I kept saying, ‘Is this a joke? Are you doing a joke?’ And then I said, ‘Of course I’ll marry you. I love you.’ And it was really nice.”</p><p>She added: “He was like, ‘Well, you always said that you wanted it to happen in our house if it ever happened.’ I was like, ‘That’s true; I wanted it to be private.’ He was like, ‘But I also knew you probably wanted to be wearing a bra and have makeup on, so I knew I had to do it after you just got home from work — otherwise it would never be another moment.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasppyoeqK1w7Jkm6qplru1ecyaqauhlah6pLvNp5yrZZ%2Birq24xLJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./see-the-white-houses-2016-christmas-decorations-w452744.html><span>←</span><span>See the White House's 2016 Christmas Decorations</span></a>
