Once they formed the iconic New World Order stable with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulk Hogan</a>,&nbsp;the real war with WWE was on.</p><p>It's always fun to play the "what if" game in the wrestling industry, but during an interview on After The Bell (h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WrestlingInc.com</a>), Nash was able to offer a very clear explanation as to what could have transpired if he didn't leave for WCW.</p><p>Nash lost his World Heavyweight Championship to Bret Hart at Survivor Series 1995, which ended his 358-day reign. Had he stayed in WWE, Nash suggested he would have refused to tack on so many losses after losing the title to Hart.</p><p>As such, the former would have wanted a victory against The Undertaker at WrestleMania XII, thus ending the latter's historic streak before it really took off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Well, if I would've stayed, I wouldn't have dropped the belt to Bret to give to Shawn unless I was guaranteed a win at Mania against Taker," Nash said. "I wouldn't have done it. I would've had too many losses in a row. I would've needed a big win right there, so there goes 'The Streak'. I'm just saying. Mark (Calaway) wasn't a mark."</p><p>"For me to do business, that could've been a possibility. I'm not saying it would've happened. I'm not saying Vince would've booked it that I would have been over. I definitely wouldn't have coughed it up without something. I was leaving, so it was like alright. There was a lot of things that could have changed."</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE Legend & Hall Of Famer Confirms That He's Retired</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Undertaker17101.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead, The Undertaker defeated Nash (performing as Diesel at the time) at WrestleMania XII to move his streak to 5-0. A loss to Diesel right then and there would have changed the history of WrestleMania forever, and&nbsp;the legend of The Undertaker would look a lot different right now.</p><p>Nobody could have guessed it at the time, but after his match with Diesel,&nbsp;it would be 18 more years until somebody finally defeated The Deadman on the Grandest Stage of Them All.</p><h2 id=everything-worked-out-for-the-better><strong>Everything Worked Out For The Better</strong></h2><p>Though Nash&nbsp;didn't end up defeating Undertaker at WrestleMania, everything simply turned out for the better. Nash enjoyed perhaps the greatest stretch run of his career in WCW, while Undertaker's legendary status reached extraordinary heights during his perfect streak. There's no telling how different everything would have been if Nash had ended the streak at 4-0, but thankfully, it didn't get to that point.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shayna Baszler Goes Full Heel On Fan For Criticizing Biting Angle</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnm5rDqrqMp5isoF2YvLa4w2afmq6VYrKvsMSdZK6mlJq%2Fta3KnqmsZaOpv6atymg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenzie-knuckles-race-parents-ethnic-background-where-is-she-from-details-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>Kenzie Knuckles Race &amp;amp; Parents| Ethnic Background -Where Is She From?
