On July 5, Albie put his bulging biceps on display in a fitted black T-shirt while posing next to his buddy Frank Catania Jr., the son of </span><i>RHONJ</i><span> newbie </span><b>Dolores Catania</b><span>.</span></p><p>And on Independence Day, Albie gave America a reason to celebrate when he uploaded a picture of himself sprawled out across a doughnut floatie while sunbathing during another pool day. In the shot, his perfectly sculpted pecs and six-pack are front and center as he smirks for the camera.</p><p>On June 16, the single stud revealed the secret behind his physical transformation: online classes with Core Rhythm Fitness. After signing up for the program earlier this year, he shared a before-and-after collage featuring a photo of himself in his softer days paired next to a present-day pic of himself in fighting form.</p><p>‚ÄúThe guy on the left was who I saw in the mirror that day, the guy on the right was who was pushing the pen,‚Äù Albie wrote. ‚ÄúI am delighted to say they are two very different people üòä.‚Äù</p><span class=caption></span><p><i>Manzo‚Äôd With Children</i> returns to Bravo for its third season on Sunday, September 11, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacmaKkuaq6xGakmqaqpMBuv86nZJqkkp6ybrPOrWSsraCav6m702aqnp1dnba0ecCmmLOhnpx6oq7SZq5ta2NrfXN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1258998-bret-hart-reggie-parks.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Bret Hart Pays Tribute To Reggie Parks, Penn &amp;amp; Teller Host A Magic Wrestling Match</span></a>
