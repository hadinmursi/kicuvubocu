He is also a member of Golden Smog.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Murphy was the secondary songwriter in Soul Asylum, with Dave Pirner responsible for bulk of the band’s material. Some of Murphy’s solo writing credits include “Can’t Go Back” from <i>Made to Be Broken</i>, “Cartoon” off <i>Hang Time</i> and “Gullible’s Travels” from <i>And the Horse They Rode in On</i>. Additionally, he and Pirner co-wrote “Easy Street” which appeared on <i>And the Horse They Rode in On</i>, and he co-wrote “Promises Broken” off <i>Let Your Dim Light Shine</i> with Marc Perlman.</p><p>In 1988, Murphy formed Golden Smog, a Minneapolis supergroup made up of members of The Replacements, The Jayhawks and Run Westy Run. Murphy was credited as ‘David Spear’ on the group’s second album, <i>Down by the Old Mainstream</i>, because of contractual obligations.</p><p>In 1992, Murphy appeared on the debut solo album by former Replacements drummer Chris Mars, <i>Horseshoes And Hand Grenades</i>.</p><p>On October 9, 2012, an official message from Dan was posted on the forum of EnterTheSoulAsylum.com regarding his departure from Soul Asylum. His decision to leave the band was to continue a quieter life with friends and family.</p><p>Murphy also has an antiques business.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fma6vecyuqamgqWK6tr%2FInKCapl2XtrCz0ZqnobFdm66kwIycmKudlad6osPAq5usZZ6awW7DzquroWWRo7FuuMifnGarpKS%2Funs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dan-shays-shay-mooneys-50-lb-weight-loss-journey-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Dan + Shay's Shay Mooney's 50-Lb Weight Loss Journey: Pics</span></a>
