It’s not much compared to the bevy of <a href=#>King’s Landing strips</a> the show has served up, but it’s not nothing. And while fans, including&nbsp;<a href=#>Anna Kendrick</a>, have complained that main characters like Daario and Jon Snow haven’t shown their privates, the rate of full nudity among the series’ stars is fairly equitable for both genders:&nbsp;Of GOT’s main and supporting female characters, only Cersei**,&nbsp;<span class=correctionMarker>&nbsp;</span>Melisandre, Osha, and Ros have gone full-frontal.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a2badf94579f1a7ae7a5d7794699d265-12-0-0@published data-word-count=99>The thing that gets elided in much of the conversation about Thrones’ nudity gender imbalance is that the harshness of onscreen nudity isn’t the same for each gender’s respective body parts. GOT has shown plenty of shirtless dudes, but — <a href=#>New York state law</a> notwithstanding — no one would argue that this is the same as the show’s parade of topless women. The campaign to get more cocks on Game of Thrones often assume that penises are a roughly equivalent level of nudity as a female breast, but in real life, we’re mostly comfortable agreeing that’s not the case.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a2badf94579f1a7ae7a5d7794699d265-13-0-0@published data-word-count=90>Is a flaccid penis a greater level of nudity than a vulva? I’m not sure. An erect penis clearly is, which is why we haven’t seen one of those on HBO since Tell Me You Love Me. (A popular urban legend says British censors once used&nbsp;<a href=#>a peninsula in Scotland</a>&nbsp;to define the exact level of tumescence at which a penis becomes obscene.) Many men would say their genitals would feel more exposed onscreen than a &nbsp;woman’s during a full-frontal scene, though it’s hard to tell if that’s just masculine insecurity talking.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a2badf94579f1a7ae7a5d7794699d265-14-0-0@published data-word-count=64>We’ll end with a note on rears: Butts are the one facet of nudity that’s more or less equally scandalous for both genders, and on that count,&nbsp;Thrones is fairly equitable. As the tumblr <a href=#>Game of Butts</a>&nbsp;can attest, eight of the show’s prominent male characters have shown their buns, compared to seven prominent female characters. It’s like they say: a Lannister always shows his butts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a2badf94579f1a7ae7a5d7794699d265-15-0-0@published data-word-count=17>**&nbsp;<span class=correctionText>This post originally left out Cersei from the list of female characters who have shown full-frontal nudity.</span></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Game of Thrones Has Never Been Afraid of Penises</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlob2dganyorcyeZKieXam1s7vNnqpmqJWjtrR5x6KqraeirnupwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./francesco-gaetano-caltagirones-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Francesco Gaetano Caltagirones Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
