The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV’s 16 and Pregnant. The debut season followed the lives of <strong><a href=#>Maci Bookout</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Catelynn Lowell</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Amber Portwood </a></strong>and<a href=#><strong> Farrah Abraham</strong></a>, who all experienced very different journeys during their teen pregnancies.</p><p>On season 5, the show was rebranded as Teen Mom OG, as multiple other spinoffs with other 16 and Pregnant cast members began — in 2011, <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a> launched; Teen Mom 3 debuted in 2013; and Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant and Teen Mom: Young Moms Club both premiered in 2018.</p><p>After many seasons of drama behind the scenes, <a href=#>Abraham was fired from the show</a> in October 2017 after a confrontation with executive producer <strong>Morgan J. Freeman</strong>. At the time, Freeman told her that if she wanted to continue her adult entertainment career, she would not be able to star on the reality show.</p><p>“I wish them all the best with the show. I’m out on a high note. This is the longest season in history and I’m their biggest star,” Abraham exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2018. “I can do my own show, but I don’t want to focus on reality TV. I’m focusing on scripted opportunities but will always enjoy a good reality TV project.”</p><p>She added: “I don’t know what the show is doing. You could take all the girls on all the series, but none can bring or do as much as I do for the series.”</p><p>In July 2018, <a href=#><strong>Bristol Palin</strong></a> was cast on the series, replacing Abraham. However, after one season, she <a href=#>chose to exit</a> in April 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Teen mom OG wasn’t a fit for me,” Palin explained via Instagram at the time. “It took away my peace.. and honestly – my peace has a price tag that no one but God can afford $ doesn’t impress me, I don’t entertain bs, and walking away from this show allows God to rebuild me (and my little fam) in the right direction. I have love for all the girls on the show, and wish them the best of luck in all their future endeavors!! xoxo, B.”</p><p><a href=#>Are You the One?</a> alum <a href=#><strong>Cheyenne Floyd</strong></a> joined the series in September 2018. In August 2019, the cast grew again, bringing on <a href=#><strong>Mackenzie Douthit</strong></a> from Teen Mom 3 as a guest mom. During the second half of season 8, she was promoted to a main cast member.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for an update on what the cast is up to today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bpsqa6jKampmWTlsC1edahnKudXZa%2FpnnToZyyZZ6kxG5%2Bj2poa3FmZLqir8qepbOhlWK6pLfEnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pitch-perfect-actress-rebel-wilson-explains-why-she-embarked-on-weight-loss-journey.html><span>←</span><span>'Pitch Perfect' Actress Rebel Wilson Explains Why She Embarked On Weight-Loss Journey</span></a>
