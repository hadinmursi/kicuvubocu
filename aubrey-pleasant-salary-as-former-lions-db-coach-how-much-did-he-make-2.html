Similarly, Ziprecruiter has recorded that a defensive coach gets an average salary of $45,000 to $50,000 per year.&nbsp;</p><p>Pleasant worked for the Rams for four seasons before joining the Lions staff in 2021. Beginning with the start of the 2021 season, he oversaw the cornerbacks & safeties in Detroit for the entire time. After his first season in Detroit, he attended interviews with Minnesota & New Orleans for the defensive coordinator position.</p><p>Aubrey had the task of preparing a youthful Detroit secondary week in & week out in 2021, helping young players experience rapid progress throughout the season while having one of the youngest position groups in the NFL.&nbsp;</p><p>The young team was the only 2021 undrafted rookie team to play at least 400 snaps on either side of the line of scrimmage, while Pleasant served as their mentor.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=aubreys-average-salary-in-wisconsin-was-36580></span>Aubrey’s Average Salary In Wisconsin Was $36,580<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He also played college football in Wisconsin; his average salary in Wisconsin is $36,580.&nbsp;</p><p>Committed to the University of Wisconsin, he was recruited as a 3-star player straight out of high school.

Following Sunday’s 31-27 loss & a 1-6 start, head coach Dan Campbell decided to break ways with Aubrey on Monday.</p><p>According to sports.yahoo, Pleasant joined Campbell’s team in 2021 & started working for the Lions. Detroit’s coaches received a lot of forgiveness for the team’s issues last year, but in 2022, the Lions’ defensive concerns have become too bad.</p><p>At 421.3 yards per game, the Lions are last in the NFL & Detroit is 27th in the league against the pass, allowing more than 265 yards per game in the air.<br>The loss against Miami, 31-27, on Sunday was the last straw for Campbell, who saw his team blow a 21-7 lead after dominating for more than 42 minutes. Tua Tagovailoa’s 382 passing yards & 3 touchdowns helped the Dolphins battle back & Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle to break the 100-yard receiving barrier.</p><p>Campbell made the first change to a defensive staff that has been accountable for numerous errors & has drawn a lot of criticism. After Pleasant left the organization, it will be up to defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn to make the necessary adjustments in time to at least partially save the 2022 season.</p><h2 id=aubrey-pleasant-began-coaching-career-at-grand-blanc-high-school><span class=ez-toc-section id=aubrey-pleasant-began-coaching-career-at-grand-blanc-high-school></span> Aubrey Pleasant Began Coaching Career At Grand Blanc High School<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pleasant started his career at Grand Blanc High School & he primarily worked with the defensive backs.</p><p>Later, he was signed by the Washington Redskins as an offensive assistant after training camp in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>In his 2012 season, he worked with defensive backs coach Raheem Morris to help rookie Bashaud Breeland develop. Breeland later tied for the rookie high with 14 passes intercepted.</p><p>After some seasons, he resigned from Washington Redskins & signed Los Angeles Rams in 2016 as their cornerback’s coach. He collaborated closely with Wade Phillips, the team’s defensive coordinator, to implement the defensive strategy in LA.
