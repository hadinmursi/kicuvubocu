It was one of the most emotional ones of the first season and the first not directed by the show’s creators, <strong>Matt</strong> and <strong>Ross Duffer</strong>. The episode was instead directed by <strong>Shawn Levy</strong>.</p><p>The ending of the episode showed Eleven (<a href=#><strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong></a>) lead the group to the water, where authorities were pulling a body out of the water. At that moment, all believe that Will (<strong>Noah Schnapp</strong>) is dead (well, except Eleven). The boys run away from her, after snapping. Mike (<strong>Finn Wolfhard</strong>) runs home and hugs his mom; Jonathan (<strong>Charlie Heaton</strong>) hugs Joyce (<a href=#><strong>Winona Ryder</strong></a>) in the street, as the sirens ring in the background.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stranger-things-easter-egg-02.jpg><p>“This may very well be the most emotional episode of the season, and a lot of that has to do with the ending. Shawn picked that <strong>Peter Gabriel</strong> cover of <a href=#><strong>David Bowie</strong></a>’s ‘Heroes’ and played it over some of our favorite shots from the show,” the Duffer brothers wrote in <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2016. “When Jonathan hugs Joyce, their bodies silhouetted by the car headlights, and the camera slowly cranes up to reveal distant sirens … it gives us goose bumps every time we watch it.”</p><p>However, the underlying message is that Will, of course, is not actually dead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stranger-things-easter-egg-01.jpg><p>In the season 3 finale, Eleven sobs after reading Hopper’s letter, and in the moments before the credits begin, the song begins: Peter Gabriel’s cover of “Heroes.” It’s safe to say that using the same song wasn’t a coincidence, but could it be a sign that Hopper is not actually dead like they all think.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>If that post-credits scene was any warning — Hopper has to be “the American,” right? — it was the perfect hint.</p><p>Stranger Things season 3 is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqtqpGjtKa%2BjK2foqaXqHqmrdKtnKtllZy0bsDHq6awq12XrqS3jK2mZquVlsCwuoxqZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./siwa-shali-resort-siwa-oasis-egypt.html><span>←</span><span>Siwa Shali Resort, Siwa Oasis, Egypt</span></a>
