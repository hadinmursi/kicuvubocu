I’ve found the selling of oils and clothes and makeup on Facebook by my old female classmates to be both&nbsp;funny and disturbing. As soon as you get that “Hey! How are you?!” Facebook message from&nbsp;someone you haven’t talked to since you were 18, you know a pitch is coming next.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq80144st8422we4t22@published data-word-count=21><strong>How often do you tweet about your personal life?

Nothing feels too private because I (often foolishly) assume the person I’m talking about isn’t fallowing me. I did have to block my dad, though, because he was showing my mom all my tweets about her. Hey, snitches get stitches!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq80146st84v41gg6q2@published data-word-count=49>I’ve also always had a bad gauge on what is too personal to talk about. For the most part, it seems like the more truthful you are the more relatable you become. I’ve exposed too much – there’s no turning back now! Oh well, guess I’ll never be president.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>When you realize you were always too good for him <a href=#>https://t.co/mA6vbzWgV9</a></p>— Richelle (@RichelleMeiss) <a href=#>March 5, 2018</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq80148st84g0ktb56p@published data-word-count=48>I love jumping on the meme bandwagon during big televised events! This video from the 2018 Oscars is hilarious. I wrote the tweet because Jennifer Garner seems&nbsp;like the sweetest person and a great mom. She deserves better than back tattoo Ben. Am I too&nbsp;involved in celebrity gossip? Absolutely.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq80149st849c0dgrck@published data-word-count=13><strong>Have you ever had a celebrity that you mention respond to a tweets?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq8014ast8462w4tk3v@published data-word-count=38>No, but I have had guys with big followings retweet me because they had a crush on me and WHAT A RUSH.

I&nbsp;keep thinking of “having a wall up” and tried to combine the two ideas. I’m also pretty bad with relationships and always falling for the wrong guys, so the combo worked!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq8014dst8467nxyml2@published data-word-count=10><strong>What are your favorite and least favorite things about Twitter?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq8014est841a502k5c@published data-word-count=65>I love how memes and jokes develop. Everyone starts tagging and hopping in on a joke, and it makes me feel like we’re all connected (I’m usually a very lonely person, can you tell?). I also like how organically the most clever/topical/hilarious things rise the top. It’s not like Facebook where you see your second cousin’s complaint about Delta Air Lines for three days straight.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq8014fst84agef48gv@published data-word-count=68>My least favorite thing is how easily it is to hop on the bandwagon of being offended about something. Sometimes I open up the app just to find out what I need to be angry about. I also don’t like all the bots. Someone needs to take care of those! Also, men can be so mean towards women. But I guess that’s every online platform. C’est la vie.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm the type of girl who buys everything organic at the grocery store then gets a pizza on the way home.</p>— Richelle (@RichelleMeiss) <a href=#>July 29, 2014</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq8014hst84r8p51c80@published data-word-count=58>I’m the worst kind of LA person. I’m like, “Is this juice COLD-pressed? No? Then I won’t be buying it,” and I’ll go eat a cookie instead. The logic makes no sense! But I still have an air of superiority about me&nbsp;because I think I know what’s “healthy.” My mom says I’m the chubbiest health-conscious person she knows.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq8014ist84f6al2mlj@published data-word-count=38>It’s weird when a stranger tells you they’re a fan and for a moment you get ahead of yourself and you’re like, “What cool name should I give my fanbase,” and then you remember it’s just one person.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq8014jst84vbum368p@published data-word-count=10><strong>What comedy do you do in addition to tweeting jokes?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjhayuzq8014kst84gwnl9cwi@published data-word-count=69>I do standup – I produce a show called Sideline at UCB Sunset every fourth Thursday of the month.
