The brown hair, brown eyed beauty arrived at the “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination”-themed event wearing a pair of golden colored contact lenses that, while only subtly different from her chocolatey natural eye hue, changed her appearance just enough to make an impact.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>On her app</a>, KKW explained that she and longtime makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic dreamed up the eye color switch because it would pop against the bronzed beauty look they were hoping to create. On the app, Kim referred to her slinky, cross-adorned Versace number as “90s-inspired” and said she wanted her glam to complement it.</p><p>“We chose honey-colored contacts that weren’t too far off from my natural eye color, just a bit brighter,” <a href=# rel=noopener>she shared</a>.”We can sometimes achieve this color when I wear a golden eyeliner and the lighting is right, but I wanted to really go for it on the red carpet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardashian-11.jpg><p>A smokey eye made from colors in the <a href=# rel=noopener>KKW x MARIO eyeshadow palette</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>KKW x Argenis Crème Eyeshadow Stick in Dramatico</a> and loads of lashes further defined the eyes, while KKW’s <a href=# rel=noopener>signature contour</a> and ‘90s-era <a href=# rel=noopener>beige lip</a> completed the look.</p><p>Just one day later, Kim attended an event in NYC channeling Cher in a vintage yellow Versace bustier dress, ultra-long locks and her trusty golden contacts. Clearly taken with the appearance-altering effects, the beauty mogul posted a pic of herself on Instagram over the weekend from a Met Gala afterparty wearing the color-changers with the caption “New Obsession. Colored Contacts.” However just how “new” her love is for the presto-chango effect could be debated considering she also <a href=# rel=noopener>experimented with blue and green lenses in 2013</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kanye-west4.jpg><p>Kim isn’t the first member of her family to experiment with a different eye color. Her husband <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kanye West</strong> </a>attended the 2016 “Manus x Machina” with his reality star wife wearing light blue lenses with his crystal-embellished Balmain jacket and ripped jeans in keeping with the robot theme. <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kendall</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> have also experimented with the look, wearing slate blue lenses over their brown eyes. It’s just one more way the clan likes to keep Us guessing.</p><p>For the latest beauty and style trends subscribe to our new podcast ‘Get Tressed With Us’ below!<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6C2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK6jLCcmqqjYrCwuM6rnJ1lk6S7ta3CrapmpJmgsm63wKewnmWnmsC1ec%2Bimqxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-nash-could-have-ended-undertakers-streak.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Nash Was Somewhat Close To Ending Undertaker's WrestleMania Streak</span></a>
