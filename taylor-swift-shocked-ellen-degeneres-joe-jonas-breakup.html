Let's take a look at how it all went down.</p><h2 id=what-happened-between-ellen-degenerse-and-taylor-swift-on-the-ellen-show>What Happened Between Ellen DeGenerse And Taylor Swift On The 'Ellen Show'?</h2><p>Looking back, Taylor Swift agrees that she did take things a little too far during the particular moment on the 'Ellen Show', <a href=#>calling out her then-boyfriend Joe Jonas.</a></p><p>“Probably when I like, put Joe Jonas on blast on your show,” she told host DeGeneres. “That was too much. Yeah, that was too much. I was 18. We laugh about it now, but that was mouthy … just teenage stuff there.”</p><p>Things completely unraveled when Ellen showed a photo of Swift alongside Jonas, this would lead to the controversial reveal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift Got Turned Down For A Film That Made $441 Million At the Box Office, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>A lot of time has passed since then, and Joe Jonas would also reveal that Swift apologized for what had taken place.</p><p>"It’s something that I was probably feeling pretty bad about when I was younger,” he shared. “At the end of the day, I’ve moved on. I’m sure Taylor’s moved on. It feels nice. We’re all friends. It’s all good. We were so young.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, although things are good now, it was a different story back in 2008. Let's take a look at how it all went down, in front of millions.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-went-into-details-about-her-breakup-from-joe-jonas>Taylor Swift Went Into Details About Her Breakup From Joe Jonas</h2><p>It all went completely south when Ellen made mention of Joe Jonas. Not only did Swift reveal the breakup, but she also went in depth, discussing exactly how they broke up.</p><p>"You know what, it’s like, when I find that person that is right for me, and he’ll be wonderful, and when I look at that person, I’m not even gonna be able to remember the boy who broke up with me over the phone in 25 seconds when I was 18,” Swift continued. “I looked at the call log, it was like 27 seconds. That’s got to be a record!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Broke Down In Tears After Taylor Swift Did This On The 'Tonight Show'</a></span></p><p>Ellen herself looked on in complete shock, and she really didn't even know how to respond. Swift would also reveal that she was able to sing about their breakup in her album at the time, Fearless, particualrly during the Forever & Always song.</p><p>Now as one can imagine, Jonas faced a lot of heat for Swift's words. However, he had his own side of what had taken place.</p><p>“For those who have expressed concern over the ’27 second’ phone call, I called to discuss feelings with the other person,” he wrote at the time. “Those feelings were obviously not well received. I did not end the conversation. Someone else did. Phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk.”</p><p>It was quite the moment and one that fans are still discussing over a decade later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-called-the-moment-the-most-rebellious-of-her-career>Taylor Swift Called The Moment The Most Rebellious Of Her Career</h2><p>In 2019, Swift made audiences remember about the moment, calling it the most rebellious of her career. The interview moment has a near 3 million views.</p><p>For the most part, fans praised Swift for keepong things real.</p><p>"Lol who’s here after Taylor talked about the most rebellious thing she did as a teenager."</p><p>"Taylor is a great role model for girls. You can hate, but deep down, she's a down to earth sweet girl who is responsible and beautiful."</p><p>"Taylor: "Drive past their houses" My mind: cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street."</p><p>"Watching this again and I never change my opinion.
