He dove into different types of films, not all of them critically acclaimed, and had fans <a href=#>wondering whether he'd outright been canceled</a> when his acting work slowed to a trickle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he continued pursuing some acting gigs, Vince seemed to have lost his passion for the craft, and wound up producing more than acting for many years. Now that he's resurfacing in acting roles, fans are wondering what happened to his passion for acting, for churning out film after film and living in the spotlight, and they're wondering whether he's back for good this time.</p><h2 id=what-has-vince-vaugh-been-doing>What Has Vince Vaugh Been Doing?</h2><p>As it turns out, Vince Vaughn has been plenty busy even though he's been living quite under-the-radar for a while now. His acting gigs were still consistent, despite headlines blaring that he'd quit acting, but they weren't as flashy as in earlier stages of Vaughn's career.</p><p>Vince's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb resume</a> has very few gaps, but it's interesting to see what he's been up to and how his passions have evidently shifted.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Vince Vaughn Is Worth $70 Million, But Is He Still Making Money?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to pinpoint Vaughn's last "big" film; it almost seems like it was the early 2000s when he was truly mainstream-popular. Plus, his now-iconic rom-com with Jennifer Aniston was all the way back in 2006.</p><p>He has worked on projects like 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' in the last couple of years, and he had a few not-so-noteworthy films, too. Although 'Freaky' caught many fans' attention because it seemed like Vince was really embracing acting once again.</p><p>So what caused his passion to wane? There are a few factors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vince-vaughn-fell-out-of-favor-a-bit>Vince Vaughn Fell Out Of Favor A Bit</h2><p>It's true that not everyone loves Vince Vaughn or his brand of acting, so he did have some not-so-rosy reviews of his work in the early 2000s. That may have contributed to his perceived downfall in Hollywood.</p><p>There's also the fact that Vince's political opinions got him in hot water a few times; speaking out wasn't quite as popular before 2016 or so. But his political ideology and support of Republican candidates isn't the only thing that had him edging out of Hollywood.</p><h2 id=vince-got-married-in-2010-to-kyla-weber>Vince Got Married In 2010 To Kyla Weber</h2><p>Fans will recall the gossipy headlines when Vince Vaughn began stepping out with his now-wife, Kyla Weber. But after they married in 2010, Vince seemed to dissolve from the public's view. Sure, there was the occasional paparazzi photo, but Vince seemed entirely content to be a family man with his new wife and later, their two children.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Vince Vaughn's Wife Kyla Weber, And What Does She Do?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vince may have just been busy being a dad and husband, something that he seemed to really embrace. So picking and choosing acting gigs, and diving more into the production side of things, was likely the path he preferred while raising his young family.</p><p>Could it be that Vince didn't necessarily lose his passion for acting, but that he became passionate about being a hands-on parent so acting went to the wayside? His children are school-age now (born in 2010 and 2013), so it makes sense if now is Vince's real time to shine in Hollywood.</p><p>And at this point, he probably has the energy back to be a more passionate actor. There's one other factor at play, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hollywood-changed-before-vince-did>Hollywood Changed Before Vince Did</h2><p>In a late 2020 interview, Vince expressed his thoughts about the pandemic and home life with two kids, but some other tidbits came about, too. For one thing, the LA Times<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> that "Hollywood has largely backed away from the type of R-rated, male-oriented comedies that were once [Vaughn's] bread and butter."</p><p>It's a simple statement that holds a lot of weight; what if Hollywood changed, and Vince got left behind?</p><p>The theory adds up, but at this point, with Vince re-entering Hollywood in a new way, it seems that everyone's priorities are lining up. With his recent work 'Freaky,' Vince says he's been choosing what interests him, rather than what people think he should do based on his acting resume or various talents.</p><h2 id=is-vince-vaughn-going-back-to-acting>Is Vince Vaughn Going Back To Acting?</h2><p>Sure, he's been filling his time with various other projects in the meantime. But fans are now <a href=#>speculating that Vince is making an acting comeback</a> because his most recent film was a fairly popular one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It does seem like Vince is moving toward more acting gigs, which suggests he may not have lost his passion for acting after all. Maybe it just took some behind-the-scenes experiences, and dabbling in different genres, for him to rekindle that spark for acting he used to have.</p><p>Either way, fans are thrilled to see he's on the big and small screen, both in front of the camera and behind it, and are eagerly awaiting his next projects.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Close Was Vince Vaughn To Starring On 'Friends'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXau2r6%2FEZq2arZedu7R5z5qqrKGfo3qnu9FmmJysmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-hemsworth-and-christian-bale-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened Between Chris Hemsworth And Christian Bale Behind The Scenes</span></a>
