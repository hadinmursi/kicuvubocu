The outfit had beautiful tailoring, including a super high collar that is great for her long neck, and a 1950s feel, modernized with a touch of origami shapes. It was important to make sure her hair not interfere with the clean lines and monochrome color, so we decided to put her hair up, which also allowed her amazing bone structure to take center stage.”</p><p>After parting hair deep on one side “to partner with the modern cuts of the clothes,” Alvow applied <a href=#>leave-in conditioner </a>from his Yarok product line to add shine and protect the First Lady’s hair from heat. He then massaged four golf ball-sized dollops of Yarok <a href=#>Feed Your Roots mousse</a> into roots to boost volume before blowdrying with a round brush.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/001-1bd3336b-3481-4447-81e4-d48dbd3713b7.jpg alt width=1000 height=563 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><i>Products from left to right: Feed Your Ends Leave-in Conditioner, $20.40; Feed Your Roots Mousse, $27.20; Feed Your Style Dry Shampoo/Styling Powder, $18.50; Feed Your Hold Hairspray, $20.40.

He loosely pulled back the remaining hair and pinned pieces above the ponytail, giving the style “an organic texture that felt carefree, natural and modern as well.” He sprayed the crown with <a href=#>medium-hold hairspray</a> formulated with organic sugar cane (what gives it the stickiness, he says) and let it set.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For the elaborate bun, he twisted sections into loops and fastened them to the back of her head, leaving a few ends out. But here’s the best part: To loosen strands and finish the look, “I had her use her hands to add a personal touch,” Alvow tells Stylish.</p><p><a href=#>Stylish by Us Weekly</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Kyra3NophmrKKqurG%2FjKKlmq2Xqr%2BiwMiopWagkZ6%2FtMDYpZxmoJ%2BserW7jJ2crZmZocBuw5NvaWpsYGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mccreamy-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-187677-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mccreamy Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
