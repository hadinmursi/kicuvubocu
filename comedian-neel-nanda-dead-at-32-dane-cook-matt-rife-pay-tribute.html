He was 32.</p><p class=p1>“I [am] deeply shocked and saddened by this. He was a wonderful comic, but a better person,” Nanda’s manager, <strong>Greg Weiss</strong>, told <a href=#>Deadline</a> in a Sunday, December 24, statement. “He had the world in front of him.”</p><p class=p1>Nanda was best known for his comedy appearances on <a href=#><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </i></a>and Comedy Central’s <i>Adam Devine’s House Party</i>. According to Weiss, Nanda had a packed schedule of appearances lined up through January and February 2024.</p><p class=p1>Nanda’s cause of death has not been publicly shared. <i>Us Weekly </i>has reached out for comment.</p><p class=p1>Following Nanda’s passing, several of his comedy peers have <a href=#>paid tribute</a> to his memory.</p><p class=p1>“RIP Neel Nanda. You were one of the nicest, hardest working comedians I’ve ever called a friend,” <strong>Matt Rife</strong> wrote via<a href=# rel=noopener>X (formerly Twitter)</a> on Saturday, December 23. “And I hope you can be at peace, brother.”</p><p class=p1>Dane Cook, for his part, also shared a poignant tribute along with the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. “I didn’t know Neel Nanda personally but reading several tributes is both heartbreaking and eye-opening. I echo so many in expressing there is help out there,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a> on Saturday. “Please remember you are never alone. People want to help you. There is a path through your pain. Prayers to Neel’s family, friends and fans. Dial 988 for help and love.”</p><p class=p1>Nanda had been a longtime comedy fan before pursuing gigs himself. He told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>VCReporter </i></a>in September 2018 that he used to copy down his favorite jokes from Comedy Central into a notebook to retell his middle school friends.</p><p>“I didn’t realize I was stealing jokes until I was in high school,” he joked to the outlet. “When I was in high school I started writing my own jokes using the structure of some of the jokes I had previously stolen. I filled up a notebook of jokes and didn’t realize until college that I could go to an open mic and tell them. I actually had a friend read the notebook and tell me, ‘You know you can just go perform these, right?’ I didn’t know, but after a quick Google search I was off to the Laughing Skull open mic.”</p><p class=p1>Nanda made his debut appearance on<strong> Jimmy Kimmel</strong>’s eponymous late-night show in 2017, where he performed a five-minute version of his <a href=#>comedy routine</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I would say my proudest accomplishment thus far in comedy is performing on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i>,” Nanda told<i> VCReporter</i>. “I’ve always wanted to do a set on late night, and <i>Jimmy Kimmel</i> was my first choice. So the fact that it came together kind of blew my mind. I’ve performed on other networks like Comedy Central, Hulu, Viceland, etc., but <i>Jimmy Kimmel</i> was the first place I performed where my parents were a fan of the host.”</p><p class=p1>Nanda later hosted the weekly show “Unnecessary Evil” at Los Angeles’ Westside Comedy Theater.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp52asaqtzWalnp2cYruiusOaZJ2dkZl6osCMbGlmnJGjsm6vzqiiZqWRqcFuvsifnGaoka56tb7Im6ytnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./full-length-floor-mirrors-boho-chic-rustic-farmhouse-home-decor.html><span>←</span><span>Check Out These 13 Floor Mirrors With Boho-Chic Vibes</span></a>
