We’ve got the same producers, same showrunner, same writers, and now we’re back with <strong>Melissa Peterman</strong> and <strong>Rex Linn,</strong> my boyfriend, and wonderful, wonderful cast and crew.”</p><p>Linn, 67, will be playing the role of the short order cook.</p><p>“He is kind of the patriarch now that [the character’s] daddy has died. ‘Cause he has been with the tavern the longest,” McEntire explained to ET.</p><p><a href=#>The couple initially met</a> on the set of <strong>Kenny Rogers</strong>’ 1991 film, The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw. They reunited three decades later in 2020 when they worked together on Young Sheldon, and their chemistry was electric. McEntire told <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a> last month that they’ve been “<a href=#>pretty much inseparable</a>” since that reunion.</p><p>Peterman, 52, starred in the Reba series as Barbra Jean Hart, who married the fictional Reba’s ex-husband, Brock Hart.

I love all genres of entertainment. But the sitcoms are so much fun, cause it’s a brand new script every week,” McEntire <a href=# rel=noopener>previously told ET </a>last month. “And you’re just having fun. It’s really hard memorizing dialogue you have to do, but it ain’t my first rodeo. I do love it. And it’s just playtime. We have a blast with it.”</p><p>She continued: “It’s gonna be that heartfelt, fun, funny, laugh at our silliness. But also, [you’ll] be touched with the heart in our show.”</p><p>In a separate interview, McEntire confirmed that she plans to sing the theme song for&nbsp;Happy’s Place. “We’ve started working on it, and we’ll have it soon finished,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a>. “If they say it’s a go, I’ll finish it up and have it ready for when we go to series.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmempFiuqSxza2gq51dqK66v4yhnKtlnprEbr%2FIrZqopV2stq24jJ%2Bcmqylp7Jurs6ynauhlaOxbr7EsWSloZ6jfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1001877-ranking-the-5-best-undertaker-vs-triple-h-matches.html><span>←</span><span>Ranking The 5 Best Undertaker vs Triple H Matches</span></a>
