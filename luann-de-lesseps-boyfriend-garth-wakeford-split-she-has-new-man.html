De Lesseps’ costar <a href=#><strong>Sonja Morgan</strong></a> claimed the “Money Can’t Buy You Class” singer was spending too much time with her then-boyfriend in the teaser. “Garth, Garth, Garth, it’s always Garth,” the 57-year-old reality star said.</p><p>The exes sparked split rumors earlier this week when an Instagram account accused the personal trainer of cheating. “Regarding this girl, we have no relationship.
