Please! As promised and teased for what seemed like years, Real Housewives of New York delivered the most outlandish and epic of catfight stunts in the history of the franchise: The fake leg throw. For the season six finale which aired on Tuesday, July 22, erratic, frequently absent housewife <strong>Aviva Drescher</strong> used a very personal prop—her artificial leg—to make a point as she bickered with her costars in the middle of Le Cirque.</p><p>Drescher was a bit of a surprise guest at Le Cirque, where <strong>Sonja Morgan</strong> was hosting a “Team Sonja” fete to acknowledge her entourage of supporters. Drescher, as fans know, had flaked on countless outings and excursions throughout the season, most notably a girls’ trip to the Berkshires and, more recently, a <strong>Kristen Taekman</strong>-coordinated jaunt to Montana. When Drescher suddenly claimed an asthma affliction prevented her from joining the ladies on the cowgirl jaunt, just about everyone smelled BS.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async width=467 height=263 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Aviva Drescher leg gif" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>At Le Cirque, <strong>Heather Thomson</strong> was quick to call her out. “This is more than asthma,” she said. When the women piled on—doubting the doctor’s X-ray Drescher had produced as proof—<strong>Ramona Singer</strong> offered, “I think it’s because you didn’t want to leave your husband.”</p><p>The sniping escalated, and Drescher dredged up an old battle with Carole Radziwill regarding the authorship of her books.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=300 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Aviva Drescher leg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When Thomson said it was “laughable” that Drescher “never lied” to the women, that apparently was the last straw.</p><p>“The only thing artificial or fake about me is this!” Drescher yelled as she thwonked her fake leg on the table. “Everything else is real! I’m sick of being called fake!” Next, she picked up the expensive, manicured, well-heeled fake leg and threw it across the room and the women and other bystanders looked on in absolute shock.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=325 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Aviva Drescher leg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Cracked Radziwill: “It ain’t over ’til the fat lady sings . . or the crazy bitch throws her leg.”</p><p>Watch the must-see moment now—replay it forever!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJivoaaWeqW%2BxKyaoZ2iYsGpvs6wZKmqn6jBqbHToppmpJWceqXB0aKloGWinbyvxYyfoKCgpGJ%2FcX2Ta2pwZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./audrina-patridge-confirms-she-briefly-dated-chris-pine.html><span>←</span><span>Audrina Patridge Confirms She Briefly Dated Chris Pine</span></a>
