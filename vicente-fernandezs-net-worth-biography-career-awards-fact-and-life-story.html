He&nbsp;earned his net worth through his many Latin films and his many performances on stage as a singer, as well as his many recordings and tours. He started his career singing for tips on the street, and went on to become a Mexican cultural icon, recording more than 50 albums and contributing to many movies.</p><p>He was born in Huentitan el Alto, Jalisco, Mexico. In 2002, the Latin Recording Academy recognized Fernandez as Person of the Year. He also has a star placed with his name at the walk of fame in Hollywood, California.&nbsp;Nicknamed as “El Rey de la Cancion Ranchera” (The King of Ranchera Music) throughout the Hispanosphere, Fernández started his career singing for tips on the street, and has since become a cultural icon, recording more than 50 albums and contributing to more than 30 films. He is the father of the popular singer Alejandro Fernández and Vicente Fernandez Jr, and uncle of Jackeline (“Jackie”) Fernandez. Vicente Fernandez has won 7 Latin Grammy Awards and 1 Grammy award.&nbsp;For over 40 years, Vicente Fernandez has maintained his position as the greatest living singer of Mexico, gathering an operatic vocal range, with a deep understanding of the roots of ranchera music.&nbsp;Although less well-known to English-speaking audiences, Fernandez has consistently filled stadiums and venues throughout his 35-plus years of performing. His repertoire consists of rancheras and other Mexican classics. He is accompanied live by a mariachi group, but he is not technically a mariachi musician, as he plays no instrument live.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK6ZmLKvwMRmnZ6qnpa7pbHZrGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fkm6GfnL%2BivMeyZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNis6Kv02aYp5xdobansYysq6iqqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./veena-nair-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-488308-html.html><span>←</span><span>Veena Nair Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
