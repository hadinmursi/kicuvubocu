Managed by Jim Cornette, the trio came to WWF in 1993, making their pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam in a match with the Steiner Brothers for the World Tag Team Championships. They worked the 1993 Survivor Series pay-per-view against The Rock ‘n’ Roll Express, as well as a dark match prior to WrestleMania X. They also wrestled as members of The Million Dollar Team at the 1994 Survivor Series prior to being released.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Del Ray and Prichard worked in ECW sporadically as The Heavenly Bodies, and Del Ray has a brief singles run in WCW as Jimmy Graffiti until a career-ending knee injury forced him to retire in 1997. He has been living in Tampa, Florida operating a wood flooring company, and making occasional wrestling-related appearances. Del Ray, Tom Prichard and Jim Cornette reunited for one final autograph signing earlier this year, at the Mid-Atlantic Legends Fanfest.&nbsp;</p><p>KILLAM: Our thoughts and condolences go out to Ferrier’s family and friends. If you want to relieve some of his moments, there is quite a bit of content on the WWE Network under “Jimmy Del Ray”. There’s a few solid Heavenly Bodies matches and even a gem from ECW on there. Rest in peace, Jimmy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgZJrbXFxXZu8s7nEq2ShnZGrsq%2B42GaZqJyZmsBuwMCgZK2dkaJ6tMDAq2SjoZ2ixm6wxKVkq5mpYr2iv9KeqmaZp5bGbq3TZmxr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-roberts-net-worth-has-soared-to-25-million-but-how-has-julia-roberts-niece-amassed-her-fortune.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Roberts Net Worth Has Reached $25 Million, But How Has Julia Roberts Niece Amassed Her Fo</span></a>
