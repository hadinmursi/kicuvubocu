I could very well end up single and alone forever. It was during that moment of doubt when I got a call from the casting director for The Bachelor.”</p><p>During the audition process, Stanton wrote that she felt “blind.”</p><p>“In these rooms, producers gave us background tests and STD screenings, had us talk to a therapist, and so on — all within a very busy day of shuttling from room to room,” she explained. “I had so many questions that went unanswered.”</p><p>Stanton made an impression on both Higgins and fans, but she was sent home after the hometown dates. She didn’t give up on finding love on reality TV, however. Her next venture was on Bachelor in Paradise season 3, where she met her future ex-fiancé <a href=#><strong>Josh Murray.</strong></a> While their relationship was rocky on the show, the former athlete’s allegedly controlling behavior, which he has denied in the past, was <a href=#>even more tumultuous when they returned home from Mexico.</a></p><p>“I was together with him for six months (seems like six years), let him get close to my children, moved him into my house, made him part of my family — and I never really knew who he was,” Stanton admitted.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The clothing designer also didn’t hold back on her relationships and subsequent breakups with<a href=#><strong> Nick Viall</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Robby Hayes</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Bobby Jacobs</strong></a> in <a href=#>Now Accepting Roses, which is available now.</a></p><p>Scroll through for 10 shocking revelations from the book:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrq6tzZ2YZquklru1u81mm6KrmJrAbrvNZqGoq5hiura%2B0ZqwZqWfp7JursCcn56kn6d6psTErGSipl2XvLC3jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./albertin-aroldis-chapman-de-la-cruz-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Albertn Aroldis Chapman de la Cruz Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parent</span></a>
