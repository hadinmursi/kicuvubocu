Ahead of the ninth-season premiere of the Logo reality series, the 13 queens vying for $100,000 and the title of America’s Next Drag Superstar already seem like <a href=#>the show’s most impressive yet</a>. To help you figure out which queen to root for, Vulture did the early prep work to determine who is the most — and least — likely to take home the crown. Will it be Aja? Peppermint? Shea Couleé? Let’s begin.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrxfw001x9vye6usygaxa@published data-word-count=117><strong>Aja<br></strong>This 22-year-old Brooklyn queen, who got her name from <a href=#>a song</a> featured in the 1982 Bollywood film Disco Dancer, draws on a broad range of pop-cultural references to describe herself — “slutty anime girl,” “Gaultier meets Mugler meets, like, furry monsters but pastel” — but even those fail to capture her range as an entertainer. The mother of the <a href=#>Haus of Aja</a> is a tight lip-syncer, handling everyone from <a href=#>Busta Rhymes</a> to <a href=#>Diva Plavalaguna</a> with ease, and embodies a degree of control in her live performances that few queens can claim. There’s a reason she won<a href=#> Drag Queen of the Year</a> at the 2016 Brooklyn Nightlife Awards, not to mention the title of <a href=#>Mr(s) Williamsburg in 2014</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabwg5p002gvdy6vlxauf1f@published data-word-count=48><i>Strengths:</i> Her makeup is flawless, her styling is on point, and her aesthetic is distinct. (Pay no attention to the <a href=#>Naomi Smalls comparisons</a> behind the curtain!) She can dance. She can <a href=#>choreograph</a>. She can even <a href=#>death-drop</a> if she has to. In short, Aja’s got a lot of strengths.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrxbs001w9vyeoaxt0qe9@published data-word-count=34><i>Weaknesses:</i><strong> </strong>Not sure how she’ll fare in the acting and singing challenges, or the impersonation-based Snatch Game.

Exhibit A: <a href=#>this high kick</a>. Exhibit B: <a href=#>this high kick into a split</a>. The 25-year-old Tennessee native is definitely pushing boundaries, but she doesn’t exactly break new ground with her pageant glamor aesthetic.

Given all that, it’s fair to assume that Jaymes will slay the sewing challenges — particularly the one that involves unconventional materials — but her Meet the Queens video sent up a bit of a red flag. She jokes that she’s “walking art” like Vivacious, but that unlike the season-six club kid, she says she’s “pretty.” That crack isn’t the kind of thing a confident competitor would say about another queen, much less a queen on another season.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrz4f002e9vyezzh4na6h@published data-word-count=16><i>Strengths:</i><strong> </strong>Her sewing abilities, <a href=#>puppetry prowess</a>, and overall craftiness will be assets to Ms. Mansfield …</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrz4p001nvdy6akkred5g@published data-word-count=11><i>Weaknesses:</i> … if she doesn’t trash talk the wrong girl first.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrz64001ovdy6mzeiymj6@published data-word-count=4>Odds she’ll win: 12–1</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrz78001pvdy6u2sbypog@published data-word-count=7>Odds she’ll hit confessional one-liner gold: 3–1</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrzb7001qvdy6msjinh47@published data-word-count=7><i>What to watch:</i> This DIY purse tutorial.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizabrza2002g9vyer51fjccn@published data-word-count=61><strong>Kimora Blac</strong><br>From her constant bragging (“Straight guys love me, gay guys love me, drag queens love me.

Also, the 37-year-old hopes to be the first transgender contestant to take home the crown.
