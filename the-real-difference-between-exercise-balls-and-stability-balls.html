Birthing balls are intended to reduce the pain felt during both pregnancy and labor. To that end, they tend to be slightly larger than the average exercise ball for the sake of comfort, and often feature an anti-slip finish to make longer sitting sessions easier without slipping off (via <a href=#>Healthline</a>).</p><p>Of course, there is more to do than merely sitting on your birthing ball. According to <a href=#>Motherly</a>, you can rock back and forth on the ball to realign the pelvis, position one one on a bed and lean against it to take the weight off the lower back, and even lean against it while on all fours both to reduce pain and to help speed up dilation. In fact, according to a 2015 meta-analysis, using a birthing ball was found to reduce both pain and anxiety in pregnant women if used before labor starts (via <a href=#>The New York Times</a>). With so many potential benefits, it should come as no surprise that plenty of famous mothers are purportedly fans, including <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a> (via <a href=#>Self</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kW5namhhZMGpsYyrnJqkXZm2p7LEq5ynm5Vir6bA1p6cp2WVrbKzr8isnGaakaG5tHnAp5tmq6SWr6q4yK2wZpqRobm0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swifts-private-jet-usage-backlash-conspiracy-theories.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift's Private Jet Usage Has Been The Source Of Backlash And Conspiracy Theories</span></a>
