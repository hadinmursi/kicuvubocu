After <a href=#>putting on the red coat and hat</a>, Scott magically <a href=#>becomes the white-bearded man</a>, even if it takes him a while to believe it.</p><p>One year later, Scott must embrace the role and deliver gifts to children near and far with help from the No. 1 elf, Bernard (<a href=#><strong>David Krumholtz</strong></a>), and his son, who never stops believing in Santa — or his dad.</p><p>In 2002, Disney released <a href=#>The Santa Clause 2</a>, which shows Scott living happily in the North Pole full time. The hiccup, however, is that he must find a wife before Christmas Eve <a href=#>or else he will have to forgo being Santa</a>.</p><p>Allen again slipped on the red suit for 2006’s The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause. This time around, Scott battles Jack Frost (<a href=#><strong>Martin Short</strong></a>) after being tricked into wishing away his role as jolly old Saint Nick.</p><p>The <a href=#>Last Man Standing</a> alum <a href=#>surprised fans in January 2022</a> when he confirmed that he would again play the dual role of Scott Calvin and Santa Claus in Disney+’s series, <a href=#>The Santa Clauses</a>. In the show, which premiered in November 2022, Scott must decide whether he’s ready to hand over his Christmas duties to someone else now that he’s turning 65.</p><p>“Getting back into the Santa Claus suit was a complicated affair because I’d forgotten — the worst part of it is they have to make a mold of your face,” Allen<a href=#> exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in November 2022, noting, “I hate to give up all these secrets. It’s like watching any of those movies done on a blue screen or green screen. It takes away all the magic.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Toy Story star</a> tried not to spoil anything for viewers but explained to Us that when his face was fitted with a plaster mold, he panicked.</p><p>“I almost had a nervous breakdown because they put a heavy liquid plaster over your face to get an image and you gotta sit there for 30 minutes as it hardens with two straws up your nose,” he revealed. “Not a good experience. And the people that did it said a lot of people don’t make it through the 15 [minute mark]. It’s kind of a torture test.”</p><p>Allen’s negative experience didn’t affect his on-set charm, according to costar <a href=#><strong>Elizabeth Mitchell</strong></a>, who plays his wife, Carol a.k.a. Mrs. Claus.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He’s a generous comedian. He wants other people to be funny and he wants them to feel fulfilled and it’s really important to him and he cares,” she exclusively told Us. “He’s a live wire but also a very constant joy.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the original stars of The Santa Clause and The Santa Clause 2 are doing now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BptaZ50pqlrZldmLmiwdKeZJyZo6l6uLTEq5xmmaKaerW0xLJkp6enZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jules-laviscount-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-175185-html.html><span>←</span><span> Jules Laviscount</span></a>
