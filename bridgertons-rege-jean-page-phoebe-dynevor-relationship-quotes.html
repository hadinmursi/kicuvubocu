But no, it has always been strictly professional. There was so much pressure on us to get it right that it was all about the work. We have a really professional working relationship,” she said. “I’m glad for that, actually. It would be very complicated if it went further.”</p><p>The British actress noted that she was “intrigued” by costars falling in love but said it hadn’t happened to her yet. “People really root for us. We have to say we’re actors, we’re doing a job,” she noted. “There is something to be said for not spoiling the magic. But at a certain point you have to say ‘no.'”</p><p>Prior to the Snatch actress’ interview with You, she and Page addressed speculation from fans about their bond on countless occasions.

The Roots alum played it coy instead, crediting the “beautiful scripts” with getting sparks to fly between himself and his costar.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Dynevor and Page may not be dating in real life, but fans can expect to enjoy more of their onscreen <a href=#>chemistry in season 2</a> of the series.
