The stunning <i>Friends</i> alum, 52, admitted to <b>Bear Grylls</b> during her Monday, August 22, episode of <i>Running Wild </i>that yes, she’s had plastic surgery.</p><p>The topic came up when Grylls asked Cox how it feels to have lived in the limelight for so long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/courteney-cox-4d8afc25-9c22-4a07-8bea-1d35b5aa5955.jpg><p>“I feel lucky. I don’t feel burdened by it. I mean, people can be pretty mean, though, now that there’s all this social media. The comments … if I ever want to feel really bad about myself, I just click on one of those … comment sections,” Cox said, explaining that a majority of people tend to make remarks about her appearance.</p><p><span>“I think there’s a pressure to maintain [your looks], not just because of fame, but just, you know, being a woman in this business. Getting older has not been … I don’t think it’s the easiest thing,” she told the 42-year-old survivalist. “I think I was trying to keep up with getting older, trying to chase that … it’s something you can’t keep up with.”</span></p><p>“So, the more you relax into it and the less I try, because sometimes you find yourself trying and then you look at a picture of yourself and go, ‘Oh, God.’ Like, you look horrible,” she continued. “I have done things that I regret, and luckily they’re things that dissolve and go away. So, um, that’s good, because it’s not always been my best look.”</p><p>That said, Cox now embraces aging and told Grylls her “new motto” is to “just let it be.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/courteney-cox-split-d1c8c473-9584-4bc6-8358-02ec801af420.jpg><p>She’s also fortunate that with age has come watching her 12-year-old daughter, <b>Coco Arquette</b>, grow up.</p><p>“There are certain parts about getting older that are fantastic. Just watching my daughter go through, you know, the game of life,” she continued. “I see so much of myself in her, and I’m glad that I’ve been through it, and learned enough now to actually help her go through things that are hard.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During their trek through the Irish Highlands, Cox <a href=#>also opened up about her personal life,</a> revealing that her brief December 2015 split from fiancé <b>Johnny McDaid</b> was more “brutal” than her divorce from ex-husband<b> David Arquette</b>.</p><p>“We were engaged for over a year and then we broke up,” she explained of her engagement to the Snow Patrol rocker, 40. “I didn’t know how to regard love the way he does. And I definitely made a lot of mistakes that I see, whether it’s co-dependency or people-pleasing. I didn’t know how to bring it in. It was always external. I definitely have learned a lot, and no matter what, I will be a better person from that breakup, even though it was so brutal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i8tr7TnqWesV2YvLl5zqdkqaSRqMGqr4ysrKuflafGbrXVnmSdp56aerW0yKeerGWZYr%2Bms9Geq2avZGiCen6TaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1398219-cody-rhodes-pays-tribute-to-terry-funk-on-8-25-wwe-smackdown.html><span>←</span><span>Cody Rhodes Pays Tribute To Terry Funk On 8/25 WWE SmackDown</span></a>
