Since they started dating the same year they've both done a great job keeping things out of the public eye regardless of how famous Swift is. They've certainly succeeded in making their relationship a topic of speculation for fans who want to know more.</p><p>After Swift's album Reputation, she released Lover, Folklore, and Evermore. These albums gave fans some insight into Swift and Alwyn's relationship. <a href=#>The albums were all packed with songs about falling in love</a>. This made it pretty clear to fans that their relationship was a strong one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Taylor Swift Has Done Since She Started Dating Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><p>After years of being together and being spotted only a couple of times in public together, fans really thought they were engaged, planning a secret wedding, or even already married. The rumors were even more fueled when it was <a href=#>rumored that there were plans for an upcoming private wedding ceremony in 2020.</a> It seems those rumors aren't really true but are not 100% confirmed to be false.</p><p>In an interview just last month, Alwyn commented on the engagement/marriage rumors. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn’t say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn’t say.”</a> Alwyn said in an interview. Fans still don't know, and it is unclear if they ever will really know. What they know for certain is that the two are a strong couple, and they're both happy together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-alwyn-39-s-role-in-39-conversations-with-friends-39>Joe Alwyn's Role In 'Conversations With Friends'</h2><p>Conversations with Friends is a new Hulu television series based on the 2017 debut novel written by Sally Rooney.

Naturally, this sparked fans' curiosities about how Taylor Swift feels about her long-term boyfriend in a role like that.</p><p>Because the two are so private with their relationship it was also a shock when they both commented on it. Joe stated that although his character on the show becomes involved in an open relationship, he is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"happy in a monogamous relationship”</a> within his off-screen life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His co-star, Alison Oliver commented on Swift's reactions to the scenes as well.

She wrote, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Can confirm it's phenomenal."</a> So it is pretty clear from all angles that Taylor Swift feels proud of the role Joe plays and is supportive of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-39-s-relationship>What's Next For Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Relationship?</h2><p>Taylor Swift is always working on something and fans know she can totally surprise them as she did with Folklore.
