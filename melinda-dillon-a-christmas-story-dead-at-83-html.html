According to <a href=#>the Second City</a>, she worked as the improv comedy club’s first-ever coat-check girl. One night, the performer Barbara Harris got sick, and Dillon had the opportunity to take the stage as an understudy. After studying acting in college, Dillon left the Midwest and moved to New York. At age 23, she made her Broadway debut in the original 1963 production of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, earning a Tony nomination for her performance as Honey.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cldp7k9sg00303b6vbwbakwyo@published data-word-count=106>Dillon starred in her first film, The April Fools, in 1969. She went on to receive a Golden Globe nomination for her role in the 1976 Woody Guthrie biopic Bound for Glory. Her other notable film and TV credits include Magnolia, The Muppet Movie, Harry and the Hendersons, Slap Shot, Sioux City, and To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.

She is survived by their son, Richard Libertini Jr.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Giant Freakin Robot</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl49460cw0000mknce0pubccg@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>E.T. and Close Encounters Told the Same Sad Story From Different Eyes</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Melinda Dillon, A Christmas Story’s Mom, Dead at 83</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgZ3yuscuipZ2ZXZm2rbjOp2SaZZOdv6q%2F06aYrGWjqbyzxYydnJqcXZbBboSSZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-ian-buchanan-wife-on-instagram-learn-everything-about-the-television-actor.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Ian Buchanan Wife On Instagram: Learn Everything About The Television Actor</span></a>
