All I have to do now is play.”</p><p>In her day-to-day life, the actress doesn’t stress much about her appearance either. “I don’t feel bound by my face or my body,” the 29-year-old said. “I don’t feel like that’s the biggest gift I have to offer the world. I feel like there are more parts of me to offer than that.”</p><p>The Argo actress admits, however, growing up she wasn’t so easy on herself. “It was tough at home, and it was tough at school,” Schilling said of feeling ugly. “My experience was painful, so painful. There was a period of time I had very short hair, and I had glasses, and I was very tall for my age.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Allure‘s 2014 July issue hits newsstands on <strong>June 30.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50pyfoqScnruoecitqmakmZeys63ToqWgZZ6kwW7DzqupsqGenHqirs6uq2akn6S4tHnIp2SooaSjr25%2Bj2pra2xmZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tania-johari-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Tania Johari Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
