Tequila anejo has a dark, rich flavor and is best enjoyed neat or on the rocks. Don’t waste it in cocktails!<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-is-smoother-anejo-or-reposado></span>Which is smoother anejo or reposado?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Añejo</b>. <b>Añejo</b> tequilas are aged from one to three years, and are considered the best type of tequila for sipping because of their smoother flavor. Añejo means “vintage”, and they are darker than reposado tequilas.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-3-types-of-tequila></span>What are the 3 types of tequila?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>There are three main types of tequila—blanco, reposado, and añejo—with two additional variations.</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Tequila Blanco. …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tequila Joven. …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tequila Reposado. …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tequila Añejo. …</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Extra Añejo.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-anejo-stronger-than-reposado></span>Is Anejo stronger than Reposado?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Tequila anejo is darker because it is aged for 12 months or longer (up to three years), whereas tequila reposado is aged for at least two months, but no more than 364 days. … For those who prefer a stronger and more flavorful tequila that can be enjoyed on its own, tequila anejo is a great choice.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-anejo-good-for></span>What is Anejo good for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Añejo Old Fashioned<p>Tequila is best known for its use in <b>classic cocktails like the Margarita and Paloma</b>. But the agave-based spirit is a workhorse that can be consumed neat or utilized in drinks from refreshing sours to potent stirred drinks. Consider the Old Fashioned.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-blanco-or-reposado-better-for-shots></span>Is Blanco or Reposado better for shots?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Whether you enjoy tequila shots or want to mix up a great margarita, today’s tequila market offers many excellent choices. Blanco tequilas are the most versatile and often preferred because they cost less, while the aged tequilas—<b>reposado</b> and añejo—are a nice upgrade worthy of the occasional splurge.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-difference-between-tequila-and-reposado></span>What is the difference between tequila and Reposado?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In simplest terms, the difference is their age.<p>Blanco is aged 0-2 months, <b>reposado 2-11 months</b>, añejo 1-3 years, and extra añejo 3+ years. This refers to the amount of time the tequila spends in oak barrels before it is bottled. Storing a bottle of reposado for a year does not make it an añejo.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-difference-between-silver-and-anejo-tequila></span>What is the difference between silver and anejo tequila?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Silver is the freshly distilled liquor that does not age at all. Reposado is “rested” for anywhere between two and eleven months in oak barrels. … Anejo means that the tequila is <b>aged for more than a year</b> in oak barrels. These tequilas are often darker in color and have settle vanilla or toasty notes from the barrels.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-reposado-a-sipping-tequila></span>Is reposado a sipping tequila?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A reposado that is aged correctly is <b>a tequila that can do it all</b>. “You might get more spice or sweet aromatics, so it’s really good to sip neat,” says Walter Easterbrook, founder of Arte Agave, a festival for agave-based spirits. “But it’s also versatile in cocktails.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-best-selling-tequila-in-the-world></span>What is the best selling tequila in the world?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>1. <b>Don Julio</b>. Founded by Don Julio Gonzalez-Frausto Estrada in 1942, the company touts itself as the world’s first premium luxury tequila. The label has become one of the most popular brands worldwide, topping the best-seller list for the sixth consecutive year.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-healthiest-tequila></span>What is the healthiest tequila?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Blanco tequila The healthiest tequila is <b>Silver or Blanco tequila</b>. This tequila is made from 100% agave and features no extra additives or sugars.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-tequila-anejo></span>What is tequila Añejo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To be considered “añejo,” the <b>tequila must be aged one-to-three years</b>, giving the drink a smokey, flavorful taste comparable to sipping Cognac or bourbon. … Extra añejo tequila (AKA extra “aged” tequila), means that the liquor has been aged for at least three years in oak barrels.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-cleanest-tequila></span>What is the cleanest tequila?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Blanco tequila, sometimes called silver or plata</b>, is the purest form of tequila; it’s made with 100 percent blue weber agave with no additives and is bottled soon after distillation.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-serve-reposado-tequila></span>How do you serve Reposado tequila?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To drink, simply take a <b>small sip of tequila straight</b> and enjoy. If you feel the need as a new tequila drinker, you can try your tequila with some lime (called limon in Mexico) and some (finely ground) salt. After every sip or two, dip your wedge of lime into a small amount of salt and suck on it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-anejo-tequila-smooth></span>Is anejo tequila smooth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Pande finds that añejo tequilas <b>tend to be smoother than their counterparts</b>, thanks to their one to three years of barrel aging.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-anejo-good-for-sipping></span>Is Anejo good for sipping?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>But, añejo tequila is, by definition, aged at least a year and up to three in oak barrels, bringing out a rounder texture and sweeter flavors. It’s not the tequila you’ll (usually) want to shoot or mix into a margarita, but it’s great as <b>a replacement for bourbon in cocktails</b> or for sipping straight.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-anejo-considered-dark-liquor></span>Is Anejo considered dark liquor?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>AÑEJO TEQUILA<p>Compared to reposado, añejo <b>is darker in color</b>, more complex, richer, and smoother in flavor. Known as vintage tequila, the amber-colored spirit is typically seen as a sipping tequila.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-makes-a-tequila-extra-anejo></span>What makes a tequila Extra Anejo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Extra añejo tequila <b>must be aged a minimum of three years in oak barrels</b>. … They’re selling a high-end spirit at a higher price for something that you only need to age for a couple more years (standard añejos spend anywhere from one-to-three years in the barrel).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-you-chill-anejo-tequila></span>Should you chill anejo tequila?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Serve it cold<p>Depending on your taste and brand preference, tequila is served <b>at either room temperature or low temperature</b> in a chilled glass.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-drink-patron-anejo></span>How do you drink Patron Anejo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-don-julio-1942-extra-anejo></span>Is Don Julio 1942 Extra Anejo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Don Julio 1942 is <b>technically an añejo</b> as it is aged for only 2 1/2 years in used American oak barrels, though it misses the extra añejo qualification by only 6 months. 1942 is the year that Don Julio Gonzáles established his distillery, Tequila Tres Magueyes.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-makes-costco-anejo-tequila></span>Who makes Costco anejo tequila?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>According to the quality ranking of website Taste Tequilla, La Madrilena is number 99 among the 136 active Mexican tequila distilleries. Beginning in January of 2019, Costco tequila became available from <b>Fabrica de Tequilas Finos</b>. Ed Hardy Tequila is made at the same distillery.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-reposado-or-anejo-better-for-margaritas></span>Is reposado or Anejo better for margaritas?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Blanco will give your margarita more of a true agave flavor while <b>reposado is</b> for those who want a smoother taste. Joven is a nice balance between the two. Don’t use añejo and extra añejo as they are too refined to mix with citrus or really anything else and should be appreciated on their own.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSdoZabsrOxzZycZpqVqcSmsc1mmKedmqR6o7jAp5qoZZGjsW6%2BxKmmrJmUpHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vanderpump-rules-scheana-shay-is-still-friends-with-ex-rob-valletta.html><span>←</span><span>Vanderpump Rules Scheana Shay Is Still Friends With Ex Rob Valletta</span></a>
