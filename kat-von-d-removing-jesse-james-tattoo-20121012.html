On Friday, the tattoo artist began the process of removing the childhood portrait of her ex-fiancé she got inked onto her left side just weeks before their first split in July 2011. Even though Von D insisted at the time she had no regrets and would never erase the tattoo, that seems to have all changed now.</p><p>Along with a photo collage of the ink getting hit with a laser thanks to Los Angeles' Dr. Tattoff she <a href=#>wrote </a>on Instagram, "AND SO IT BEGINS! First round of tattoo removal well underway!" adding the hashtag #freshstart. Von D, who is now dating electro-house artist DeadMau5 (again, after briefly breaking up in November), also added a photo of herself giving a thumbs up to the camera.</p><p>[Related: <a href=#>Celeb Tattoos Gone Wrong (Photos)</a>]</p><p>But Von D isn't completely free from the "West Coast Choppers" star just yet. Removing a tattoo takes anywhere from five to 15 laser sessions, with eight weeks of healing time in between.</p><p>James, who recently got engaged to Paul Mitchell heiress Alexis DeJoria, isn't the only ex who the former reality star has honored with a tattoo. Von D, 30, also has the name of her ex-husband, Oliver Peck, etched onto her neck, at least 10 tattoos about ex-boyfriend Alex Orbison (son of the late Roy Orbison), and a "J" on her ankle she got as a teen for her first love, a boy named James.</p><p>Let's hope Kat has learned her lesson and doesn't get a tattoo for DeadMau5!</p><p><strong>More celebrity features on Yahoo!:<br></strong></p><p><a href=#>Megan Fox's Ultimatum to Brian Austin Green: Nanny or Divorce</a></p><p><a href=#>Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady Welcome a Baby Girl</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Suri Visits Katie Holmes on Broadway</a></p><p><a href=#>Follow omg! on Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaRiw7C6jJ1kq52dpMOqusZmoZ6ro5p6q63MnqpmrJGpwbC7jGtnamphZX5zew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-verlander-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Verlander: 25 Things You Dont Know About Me</span></a>
