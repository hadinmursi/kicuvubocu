As viewers of the hit Netflix show <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> will tell you, there are few things the employees of the series’ Oppenheim Group agree on more than their collective distaste for the real estate company’s branded wine.</p><p>The black bottles, which all have the business’ “O” logo on them, are often seen in shots on the streaming show and the wine is frequently referenced by the cast — often not in the most flattering light.</p><p>While there’s still plenty we need to learn about the wine, we do know that there are both red and white varieties, and that the wine is almost always served at Oppenheim open houses as well as various company events. For example, the menu for the Friendsgiving party in season 3 boasted multiple drink options, including the first-billed beverage, “Oppenheim Group Select Red lobster & White Wine.”</p><p>Cast member <a href=#><strong>Christine Quinn</strong></a> was less than thrilled to be sipping on the custom vino during the holiday meal. “I can’t believe I’m drinking the Oppenheim Group wine, Jesus Christ,” the 31-year-old told her coworkers, including <a href=#><strong>Maya Vander</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Heather Rae Young</strong></a>, as she poured herself a glass. “That’s how you know I was desperate.”</p><p>As Vander, 32, noted: “It’s actually not good.”</p><p>“It’s not, it’s awful,” Quinn replied.</p><p>Though it’s not exactly clear what types of wine twins <strong>Jason</strong> and <strong>Brett Oppenheim</strong>, 43, created, eagle-eyed Selling Sunset watchers believe the white wine is a chardonnay, while the red wine is likely a blend of some kind. The label is called “O” and it hails from a Paso Robles, California, winery.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Netflix series, which premiered via the streaming service in March 2019, dropped its third season earlier this month. Recently, the <a href=#>veracity of the reality show</a> was called into question after <a href=#><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a> tweeted on August 18 that she was <a href=#>unfamiliar with the show’s bevy of attractive real estate agents</a>. “I look at LA real estate a lot and have never seen any of these people lol either have our agents, who I have obsessively asked,” the 34-year-old Cravings author wrote.</p><p>Still, cast member <a href=#><strong>Mary Fitzgerald</strong></a> told Us Weekly exclusively earlier this month that <a href=#>there’s nothing made up about the show</a>. “It’s not fake,” the 39-year-old realtor explained. “We try to put as much of our lives out there as possible. I think sometimes things get played out of order. Like they’ll film things and then, and then they can show like one scene before it actually happened in real life. Just because for viewers, they need to set it up like one way so it makes sense.”</p><p>Scroll down to learn everything we know about The Oppenheim Group wine!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2TAprjLoqWgZaOqu7Sx06xkqKigmrupscimZKCqn6q9bsPIp5xmnaaav7rAx6KloGWnmnqsus6wZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samaire-armstrong-movies-husband-body-career-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Samaire Armstrong Movies, Husband, Body, Career &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
