Haven’t really moved in the past 2+ days, and [have] been receiving lots of help from my amazing husband and the grandmas,” the <a href=#>Duck Dynasty</a> star, 23, wrote via her Instagram Story on Friday, May 21.</p><p>She continued, “However I have had the best cuddles ever from the snuggle bug 😍. I will say postpartum has been so special in a million ways (truly), but the pain is real and can’t just be ignored. Learning to be still and accept help so that I can be the best mom I can to my baby girl.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sadie-Robertson-Talks-Postpartum-Journey-Says-the-Pain-Is-Real-One-Week-After-Giving-Birth.jpg><p>The Louisiana native <a href=#>welcomed her daughter</a>, Honey James Huff, with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Christian Huff</strong></a>, on May 11.</p><p>“We saw a million little miracles yesterday — the best one being this girl right here,” she <a href=#>wrote</a> via Instagram the following day. “Honey 💛 The pure goodness of God. Story to come, but I’m way too occupied right now by cuteness.”</p><p>A week after giving birth, she shared a list of lessons she’d learned from her daughter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[One] week and you’ve officially changed me for the better. I’ve learned that before I ever get to really teach you a thing you will teach me a million,” the Live Fearless author <a href=#>wrote</a> via Instagram. “To see a miracle you have to go through a moment of desperation, fear and even pain, but none of those feelings compare to the gratitude of receiving the miracle.”</p><p>Robertson <a href=#>announced her pregnancy</a> in October 2020 with an Instagram photo of her and her husband holding up ultrasound images. Two months later, she revealed that she <a href=#>first felt like a mom</a> while <a href=#>battling COVID-19</a> early in her pregnancy during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.</p><p>“I knew I needed to go to the hospital, and typically [I would not have]. Like, I’ll just recover. I’ll be fine. But in that moment, I was like, ‘No. We have to make sure the baby’s OK,’” she said. “It [was] not really about me. It was more about her and getting health for her. So that was a really cool thing to go through even though it was hard.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasmZSesm6%2Bzpucq6yjpLtuv8CyqmasmJp6sa3Ip2Siq12nsqK4jJqdrZ2iYrSqwsinnmaamafBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rocio-pino-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-89151-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rocio Pino Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
