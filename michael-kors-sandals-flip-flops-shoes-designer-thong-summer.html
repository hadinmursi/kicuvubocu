From fabulous clothing, to bags, to footwear, the brand is forever producing our top picks in any category. Now that we’re on the search for summer essentials, we obviously turned to the designer for inspiration, and we found <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a> we wish we could wear all year round!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MICHAEL Michael Kors MK Plate Flat Thong Sandals</a> aren’t just some throwaway pair of flip flops. These are designer, and we can tell right at first glance. The design, the details, the artistry . . . insert an Italian chef kiss here. Perfection!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MK-Sandals-Luggage.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> MICHAEL Michael Kors MK Plate Flat Thong Sandals</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$79</a> at Macy’s!</strong></p><p>As to be expected, these sandals have already garnered hundreds of reviews. Shoppers are calling them “the most comfortable flat sandals [they’ve] ever owned,” shocked at how they can wear them all day and barely even feel them. Since they’re available in so many colors, shoppers are collecting them all, loving how they “look spectacular” with anything they wear. One described them as “the perfect balance of comfortable, simple and attractive,” and we agree in every sense!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These sandals</a> are thong style, with a round open toe. They feature an adjustable ankle strap, which isn’t always the case when it comes to sandals like this, so we love the option for customization and improved fit. The buckle of the ankle strap matches with the color of the metallic logo plate on the leather upper, which varies between gold-tone and silver-tone based on which shoe we buy.</p><p>This metallic logo plate features the designer’s name and the hint of glimmer it adds to the shoe provides just enough glamor to impress even when paired with cut-off denim shorts and a simple tank top or cami. Also, off to either side, we’ll find two pairs of matching button hardware details!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MK-Sandals-Grecian.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> MICHAEL Michael Kors MK Plate Flat Thong Sandals</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$79</a> at Macy’s!</strong></p><p>Let’s get into the incredible color selection. Love the logo plate, but want even more of an elegant shine? There are two options that provide just that. Sterling Silver and Pale Gold feature hardware that matches the upper of the corresponding shoe and either pair can be worn with any outfit, dressing it up with ease! Serious ease.</p><p>The options aren’t even close to over. Check out Optic White for a simple sandal with gold hardware, or take it up a notch with Bright White, which has both silver hardware and super subtle “MK” print covering the upper!</p><p>Bigger fan of darker colors? Black is, of course, an option, as well as the deep Brown, which also features a super subtle “MK” print. For a lighter, more caramel brown, check out Luggage!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MK-Sandals-Pink.jpg><p>Looking to have a little more fun with colors? Carnation Pink is a delicate floral shade, while Sea Coral is a vibrant red. If we’re hoping for something more in the orange realm, the cutely-named Tangerine might be for us! If we’re feeling blue (the color, not the emotion), the Santorini-inspired Grecian Blue or the more muted Dark Chambray are two gorgeous options!</p><p>For less than $80, we can snag a pair of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">designer shoes</a> that we don’t have to save for once-a-year special occasions, but are still endlessly chic. Obviously we’re getting in on that! Now we just have to pick our starting colors!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> MICHAEL Michael Kors MK Plate Flat Thong Sandals</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$79</a> at Macy’s!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
