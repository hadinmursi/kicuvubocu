Creatures live within <b>Yggdrasil</b>, including the dragon Níðhöggr, an unnamed eagle, and the stags Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-we-pronounce-god></span>How do we pronounce God?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-pronounce-mjolnir></span>How do you pronounce Mjolnir?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The j in <b>Mjolnir</b> is pronounced as the letter y. If you were to say it slowly out loud, the way that it’s supposed to sound, you’ll get the correct <b>Mjolnir pronunciation</b>. Slowly read out “Me-yol-neer”. To make it sound the way it should when speaking normally read out “myol-nir”.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-thors-axe-name></span>What is Thor’s AXE name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In Infinity War, <b>Thor</b> (Chris Hemsworth) — accompanied by Groot and Rocket — travels to Nidavellir, where a new weapon is forged for him: an <b>ax</b> called Stormbreaker.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-thors-real-name></span>What is Thor’s real name?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Thor (Marvel Comics)<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th colspan=2 style=text-align:center;padding-left:0>Thor</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Created by</td><td><b>Stan Lee</b> Larry Lieber Jack Kirby</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2 style=text-align:center;padding-left:0>In-story information</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Full name</td><td>Thor Odinson</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Species</td><td>Asgardian</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-thor-fly-without-hammer></span>Can Thor fly without Hammer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Originally Answered: <b>Can Thor fly without</b> Mjolnir? Yes, he <b>can</b>, and he did in <b>Thor</b>: Ragnarok. <b>Thor’s</b> powers do not come from his <b>hammer</b>, but from his own body.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-loki-in-human-years></span>How old is Loki in human years?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Thor is 30 <b>years old</b> in <b>human</b> terms. 1,070/5,000. <b>Loki</b> is 21.4 <b>years old</b> compared to a <b>human</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-thor-lift-a-planet></span>Can Thor lift a planet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>He has <b>lifted</b> the weight if 20 <b>planets</b> in 1aone comic. He overpowered and broke the grip of the Midgard Serpent. then battled him. Then carried him to the World Tree and tied him in a knot in another comic.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-thor-stronger-than-superman></span>Is Thor stronger than Superman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In terms of the power to lift and move large objects, <b>Superman</b> has a <b>stronger</b> edge against <b>Thor</b>. <b>Thor</b> may have been able to move objects that weigh as much as planets, but the Silver Age <b>Superman</b> not only pushed actual planets out of orbit all the time, but even went so far as to move entire galaxies on a whim.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-heavy-is-thors-hammer></span>How heavy is Thor’s hammer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>And Mathaudhu can cite documentary sources to back him up. For example, Marvel – which publishes the Thor comics – issued a “<b>Thor’s Hammer</b>” trading card in 1991 that states <b>Mjolnir</b> is made of Uru and <b>weighs</b> precisely 42.3 pounds. That’s lighter than a herd of 300 billion mice, much less a herd of 300 billion elephants.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-thor-beat-superman></span>Can Thor beat Superman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yes, <b>Thor</b> has magic on his side and <b>can</b> hurt <b>Superman</b>. However, <b>Superman</b> has <b>defeated</b> magical foes in the past because he doesn’t just stand there and let them hit him with magic.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-thor-beat-goku></span>Can Thor beat Goku?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In a fight against <b>Goku</b>, though, <b>Thor</b> wouldn’t come out on top. He’d have his electricity and his super strength, but when compared to a Super Saiyan, he just doesn’t measure up. He’d put up a decent fight (and that includes the lightning powers we saw in <b>Thor</b>: Ragnarok), but in the end, <b>Goku</b> is just more powerful.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-superman-beat-hulk></span>Can Superman beat Hulk?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Superman</b> has beaten <b>Hulk</b> before in the comics, as we’ve seen in the Marvel vs. However, while the two characters <b>can</b> match each other in strength with <b>Hulk</b> eventually growing stronger than <b>Superman</b>, the Man of Steel has far too many other powers that could help take <b>Hulk</b> out before he got to his maximum enraged levels.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-superman-use-thors-hammer></span>Can Superman use Thor’s hammer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>So, there you have it: yes, <b>Superman</b> is capable of wielding <b>Mjolnir</b>, although he was only seen to have done so on an emergency basis — and, in fact, it appears that Wonder Woman is more unconditionally worthy of the weapon than he.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-deadpool-lift-mjolnir></span>Can Deadpool lift Mjolnir?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Deadpool</b> never <b>lift Thor hammer</b>. Deathpool <b>lift</b> a fake hammer that look like <b>thor hammer</b>. in comic book <b>deadpool lift</b> a hammer its true but its a magical hammer create by loki.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-goku-lift-mjolnir></span>Can Goku lift Mjolnir?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>So yes, <b>Goku can lift Thor’s hammer</b> cause he is worthy in Odin’s eyes and even if he wasn’t worthy he might be able to <b>lift</b> it by pure strength cause he is strong enough to break the “worthy” enchantment on <b>Mjolnir</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-batman-worthy-of-mjolnir></span>Is Batman worthy of Mjolnir?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It’s also important to note that although certain versions of <b>Batman</b> have killed people, being willing to take life <b>does</b> not disqualify <b>Batman</b> from being <b>worthy of Mjolnir</b>. Based on all of this, <b>Batman would</b> almost definitely be capable of lifting <b>Thor’s hammer</b> and gaining the powers of a Thunder God.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6sb7Op6auppOaerqzxp2pmquZoXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-old-is-tubbo-age-and-wikipedia-is-he-older-than-ranboo.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Is Tubbo?
