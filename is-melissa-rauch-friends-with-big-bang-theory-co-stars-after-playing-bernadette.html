Of course, the actress is so talented that she has continued to take on roles since the show went off the air in 2019. Even though <a href=#>TBBT fans were split on Bernadette</a>, there's no question that Rauch became an integral member of the cast.</p><p>Since Melissa Rauch has always been positive about her days on The Big Bang Theory set, fans hope that she has maintained relationships with her co-stars since the series finale. There's nothing more upsetting and disappointing than learning that a TV cast secretly dislikes each other. Here's the truth about how friendly Melissa Rauch is with the other The Big Bang Theory actors.</p><h2 id=is-the-big-bang-theory-star-melissa-rauch-friends-with-mayim-bialik-today>Is The Big Bang Theory Star Melissa Rauch Friends With Mayim Bialik Today?</h2><p>Since Melissa Rauch and Mayim Bialik were cast on The Big Bang Theory later than their co-stars, fans are often curious about whether they are friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mayim-bialik-melissa-rauch-and-kaley-cuoco.png><p>Viewers first see Rauch and Bialik's characters Bernadette Rostenkowski and Amy Farrah Fowler in season 3 of the sitcom.

In general, The Big Bang Theory seemed to have a friendly and positive cast who loved being together on set. Even back in 2016, when Rauch starred in the movie The Bronze, Bialik interviewed her about the project for the website Kveller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2019, when the sitcom was ending, Bilak shared a beautiful message about Rauch on her Instagram account. She summed up the good times they had shared together and it sounded like she really cared about her costar.</p><p>She wrote, "This lady and I have been through a lot together as the new kids on the block of season 3 of [Big Bang Theory]. We have cried together and laughed together and raised kids on a set together. I couldn't have made it without her with any semblance of sanity. Thank you [themelissarauch] for being you. You're so much more than [thebronzemovie] to me. You're solid gold."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/why-mayim-bialik-and-melissa-rauch-felt-out-of-place-during-big-bang-theory-events-and-photoshoots.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whenever the actors are asked about their castmates, they always talk about trying their best to remain close. In August 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayim Bialik talked about The Big Bang Theory cast</a> in an interview with Us Weekly, and Rauch was one of the actors that she mentioned.</p><p>Bialik said, “Melissa [Rauch] [and] I [have] talked to Simon [Helberg]. I actually wrote a screenplay and I’ve been wanting to cast him in this screenplay, so I was able to do that. I don’t know if we’ll get to make the movie ‘cause quarantine.” She also mentioned that Jim Parsons was a producer on her sitcom Call Me Kat, which enabled them to stay in contact with each other.</p><p>In a 2020 interview with Fox News, Bialik said "I talk to Melissa most often." It's really nice to hear that the two actors are still so special to each other.</p><h2 id=is-melissa-rauch-still-friendly-with-the-rest-of-the-big-bang-theory-cast>Is Melissa Rauch Still Friendly With The Rest Of The Big Bang Theory Cast?</h2><p>Melissa Rauch has always shared how much she loves her co-stars. In 2016, she told Smashing Interviews, "I love the TV family that I am so lucky to be a part of.

According to Metro.co.uk, the actress shared about this project on Instagram. Kunal Nayyar, who played Raj Koothrappali, wrote, "Beautiful!" Kaley Cuoco, who became famous for her portrayal of Penny, commented, "Loving this sooooooo much!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Melissa Rauch's more recent interviews tend to focus on her role in Night Court, which makes sense since it sounds like she truly loves this project. She doesn't talk about her friendships all that much.</p><p>However, when many of her castmates talk to the media, they often mention that they are all still great friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/melissa-rauch-and-kaley-cuoco.png><p>In March 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaley Cuoco talked about her co-stars</a> in an interview with Metro.co.uk and said that at that point in time, they were texting one another regularly.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Moment-Fans-Noticed-Melissa-Rauchs-Voice-Change-On-The-Big-Bang-Theory.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Melissa Rauch Really Felt About Bernadette Marrying Howard On The Big Bang Theory</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>​​​​​​​Some people are on the fence about their union, but Melissa Rauch has made her thoughts on the couple perfectly known.</span><p>Cuoco said, "Everyone is really doing great.

We had a unique experience for so long so to see everyone doing the things they want to be doing and successful. The texts are always happening."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/melissa-rauch-has-moved-on-and-is-in-a-lead-role-on-night-court-but-she-hasn-t-ruled-out-a-big-bang-theory-return.jpg><p>In her 2020 Fox News interview, Mayim Bialik talked about the reality of staying in touch with former co-workers. She was honest about the reality of the situation and said, "It’s obviously different to have a relationship with people when the thing that brought you together doesn't exist. We don't have a place to go to work together to hang out. We've had some group communication for sure."</p><p>While of course she was totally right, it's still bittersweet to think about the show ending. The cast was used to seeing each other all the time and so this must have been a huge adjustment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Big Bang Theory actors must feel good that even though they aren't on set together all the time anymore, they always prove that they still matter to each other. It's hard to imagine Melissa Rauch and her co-stars ever fighting or deciding that they don't want to be friends anymore. They shared something special and it doesn't sound like they will ever forget the experience of starring in The Big Bang Theory together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWdmrmqv9KaZKuZpZi1brLRopynnKNixKrAx2aZop9dl66vs4ytn56noq56pLuMrKuaqqNirqfAxKtkqaSRrravs4ybnKumkZmytcDEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-karlie-redd-pregnant.html><span>←</span><span>Is Karlie Redd Pregnant?
