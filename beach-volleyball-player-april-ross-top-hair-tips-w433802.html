The Aussie Hair Products spokeswoman knows a thing or two about keeping her locks looking good on and off the court. “The summer is usually the time of year when I’m always training and competing, so my hair takes a bigger beating,” she tells </span><i>Us Weekly</i><span>. Keep reading to see her top tips, including how she deals with post-match hat hair! &nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Cover Up</b></p><p>“I always wear a hat or a visor when I’m in the sun,” the 2012 Summer Olympic silver medalist, 34, tells <i>Us</i>.</p><p><b>Condition Liberally</b></p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/aussie-5bc215fb-82ac-45c5-8deb-c2481cb6919b.jpg alt=Aussie width=680 height=496 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><i>From left: Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deep Conditioner ($3.99, <a href=#>drugstore.com</a>),&nbsp;Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Conditioner ($4.49, <a href=#>drugstore.com</a>)</i></p><p>Because the sun dries her hair out, moisturizing is a major key for Ross. “I don’t shampoo all the time, but I do use the 3 Minute Miracle Moist a few times a week,” she says. “Then I’ll regularly use the Aussie Total Miracle 7N1 Conditioner. It rehydrates my hair really well!”&nbsp;</p><p>Ross also relies on the elements to refresh her strands. “If I’m at the beach for a good amount of time, I like to jump in the ocean to get my hair wet,” she notes.</p><span class=caption></span><p><b>Aim High</b></p><p>To keep her strands out of the way when she’s serving, Ross wears her hair up. “I tend to do a high ponytail with a braid,” she reveals. “When I’m hanging out, I throw it up in a messy bun, and sometimes a side braid over my shoulders.”</p><p>But she does like to switch things up for special occasions. “If I’m going to an event or to dinner, I like to wear it out with a side part,” she continues. “My side-swept ESPYs look is one of my favorite hair moments! I always like to integrate a braid when I get my hair done for events, too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/aussie-5bc215fb-82ac-45c5-8deb-c2481cb6919b.jpg><p><b>Own Your Hat Hair</b></p><p>Visors and caps shield her eyes from the sun during games, but they don’t cramp her style afterwards. “I don’t avoid hat hair! If you see me after match, I have hat hair,” she says. “After I’m off the court, I shake my hair out and throw it up in a messy bun and then it’s OK. But I generally like my hair every day – awesomely messy hair is rad. I think owning what you have lets you have a great hair day every day.”</p><p>Someone who always has great hair days, in her eyes? “<b>Blake Lively</b>!” Ross says. “Her hair is super thick, long and wavy. It’s perfect.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5eyoq%2FHZq2opJyaxqOty6VkqaSRrrKzecCpqaKkXae8tL%2BMraapZZiWtrN506KnrGWnaYB0hI9rZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bam-adebayo-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-113536-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bam Adebayo Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
