It takes a lot to get suspended from the UFC, let alone banned for life from ever competing in the promotion ever again. Of course, just because a lot of effort to get sacked does not mean a lot of effort has not been made by certain fighters. In most cases of suspensions or being banned, it has to do with something that a fighter has done outside of the octagon (usually it happens to be a felony charge, a fight, or simply failing a substance abuse test for the USADA).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Guide to 'Below Deck' and Its Many Spinoffs: Photos</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>

MTV has canceled its strange hipster sex comedy I Just Want My Pants Back, which is a strange hipster sex comedy bummer. The show was sort of a wreck a lot of the time, but there were bright moments of actual originality, and the show had a bawdy audacity that’s really hard to come by. It’s hard to imagine the series landing elsewhere — it’s too young for FX, too raunchy for the CW, too edgy for ABC Family, too dumb for IFC, and is just not that good a show.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Albertn Aroldis Chapman de la Cruz Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parent</h2><time>Aug 29, 2024</time>
