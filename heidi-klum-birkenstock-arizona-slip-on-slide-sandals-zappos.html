Not only did she have a seriously successful modeling career strutting down catwalks around the world, she was also the host of Project Runway — and more recently, she took her talents to Amazon to find the next big designer with Making the Cut. So naturally, all eyes are on Klum when it comes to style. We prefer to get our outfit inspiration straight from the professionals, which is why we’re always <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">paying attention to her favorite labels</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Klum is known</a> for her love of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Birkenstock sandals</a>. In fact, the 47-year-old once collaborated with the beloved brand. And why wouldn’t she? When it comes to everyday footwear, the Birkenstock is simply the best.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Birkenstock-Arizona-White-Birko-Flor.jpg><p>Birkenstock Arizona (White Birko-Flor)</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class=Jw>Birkenstock&nbsp;</span></a><span class=Kw><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Arizona</a> with free shipping for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$100</a>, available from Zappos!</span></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Birkenstocks</a> have been a crucial part of the fashion zeitgeist for decades now! These <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a> are easy to throw on, incredibly durable and they’re unquestionably some of the the most comfortable shoes you can own. They have hundreds of five-star reviews on Zappos, and shoppers can’t get enough of them. We’re definitely not surprised that Klum owns <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these shoes</a> in multiple shades!</p><p>What, exactly, makes these sandals so popular? For starters, they have a unique cork footbed that’s curved in the right places to support your feet all day long. That’s precisely why you can wear these shoes pretty much anywhere and look stylish every time! You can team <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">these sandals</a> with different dresses, skirts, jeans or even <a href=# data-link=1>sweats</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Birkenstock-Arizona-White-Birko-Flor-2.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class=Jw>Birkenstock&nbsp;</span></a><span class=Kw><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Arizona</a> with free shipping for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$100</a>, available from Zappos!</span></strong></p><p>The sandals have two wide buckle straps that come in a bright white hue. The buckles match the bottom layer of the sole to complete the look. Another great thing about the cork material is that over time, it actually molds to your unique foot shape for an even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">more satisfying fit</a>!</p><p>These shoes have shock-absorbing properties and you can undoubtedly wear them when you’re walking on rough surfaces. You can even rock these sandals while going for a simple, brisk hike. If a star like Klum is a fan, then we know we’re going to love them too!
