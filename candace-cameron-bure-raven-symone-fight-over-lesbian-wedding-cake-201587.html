It depends on who you ask. <strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong> assumed a seat at The View's co-host table for the Hot Topics segment on the Tuesday, July 7 episode, and things got typically heated. An ultra-conservative Christian, Cameron Bure couldn't help but butt heads with co-host <strong>Raven-Symone</strong> one topic, which discussed an Oregon bakery's decision to refuse service to a lesbian couple.</p><p>"The Oregon law bars businesses from discriminating against sexual orientation, race, disability, age or religion," Symone argued, "and to me, it’s the same exact thing that they did back in the day saying that black people couldn’t do certain things because it's my 'religious belief.'"</p><p>Fuller House's Cameron Bure, 39, quickly accused Symone, a fellow child star, of comparing apples to oranges. "I don’t think this is discrimination at all. This is about freedom of association," she said. "It's about constitutional rights. It's about First Amendment rights. We do have the right to still choose who we associate with."</p><p>"[The bakery] didn't refuse to bake the cake because of [the couple's] sexual orientation," she continued. "In fact, they baked cakes for them previously. They had a problem with the actual ceremony because that — the ceremony — is what conflicted with their religious beliefs. They are saying that they stand for marriage between a man and a woman."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As Cameron Bure trailed on, Symone cut her off. "I refuse to associate with you right now," said Symone, who told <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> in 2014 that she was in a relationship with a woman. <strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> sided with Symone. "Were [the bakers] invited to the wedding?" the comic asked. (The answer: No.)</p><p>Earlier this month, the Oregon Labor Commission ordered Aaron and Melissa Klein, the former owners of the Sweet Cakes by Melissa bakery in Gresham, Ore., to <a href=#>pay $135,000 to compensate Rachel and Laurel Bowman-Cryer</a> for the emotional and mental anguish they suffered when the Kleins refused to make their wedding cake. Aaron and Melissa Klein, devout Christians, have vowed to appeal the ruling. "We will not give up this fight, and we will not be silenced," they wrote on Facebook. "We stand for God's truth, God's word and freedom for all Americans."</p><p>The Bowman-Cryers held a commitment ceremony in June 2013 and were formally married in May 2014 after a federal judge struck down Oregon's same-sex marriage ban.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ6ZrqSxjJyYpp2ipLturtSrnGaqkauyr3nSsqSoppVis6qzx61kqK6Vp3qtsdKboJqmXayypbDIp55mm5Ggsm5%2Bj2pscW9f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./burcu-biricik-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-590717-html.html><span>←</span><span>Burcu Biricik Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
