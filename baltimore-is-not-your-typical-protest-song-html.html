Despite the somber subject matter (or perhaps because of it), it’s an upbeat tune with a simple refrain and quaint melody, reminiscent of music from Pete Seeger and other folk icons. “Baltimore” opens with a harmonic chant led by <span>vocalist Eryn Allen Kane<span class=Apple-converted-space>, </span></span>a slick rhythm guitar intro, and no-frills bass line and drums. It ends with what sounds like a police broadcast warning of a “developing situation in Los Angeles,” a possible reference to the 1992 L.A. riots. Those two bookends frame the song’s central cri de coeur: “Enough is enough, it’s time for love.”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f83e390e77aa7b251a78ca27ffb8568-5-0-0@published data-word-count=135><span>When I first heard “Baltimore,” I wanted it to be angrier. I wanted a 2015 purple version of “<a href=#>Fuck Tha Police</a>.” I wanted it to be a searing indictment that would silence anyone who felt <span>Michael Brown, Tamir Rice,&nbsp;Trayvon Martin, or Freddie Gray</span> got what they deserved. I felt the song — like most traditional protest music from “We Shall Overcome” to “Blowin’ in the Wind” — was too passive. But then I realized I wasn’t listening closely enough to its most important lyric: “Peace is more than the absence of war.” It’s a compact statement that packs a lot of punch. What does peace look like today? Is it attainable? Why have we let it elude us? These are questions that help define the current unrest playing out in protests all across the country.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f83e390e77aa7b251a78ca27ffb8568-6-0-0@published data-word-count=75><span>“The system is broken. It’s going to take the young people to fix it this time. We need new ideas, new life,” <a href=#>Prince said from the stage</a>, echoing statements made recently by State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, 35, a guest of honor at last night’s concert. During her first press conference to announce the charges against the officers responsible for the arrest of Freddie Gray, she told the world, “<a href=#>As young people, our time is now</a>.”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-6f83e390e77aa7b251a78ca27ffb8568-7-0-0@published data-word-count=70><span>“Baltimore” is not just another protest song; it’s the sonic embodiment of that message — a vote of confidence from one of the greatest songwriters of all time reassuring young people that their voices are being heard and that their time is now. It’s<span> not a defiant anthem</span>, and it doesn’t need to be. It catches the spirit of a new movement that’s already begun and is just getting started.<br></span></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>‘Baltimore’ Is Not Your Typical Protest Song</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdganyjrcutoKanopp6qr%2BMp6atZamkwrN507KnopuRoXqxvs6tnKysXai8r7ONoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikki-brie-bella-open-up-about-their-beauty-line-nicole-brizee.html><span>←</span><span>Nikki, Brie Bella Open Up About Their Beauty Line Nicole + Brizee</span></a>
