We hope that you respect our privacy during this difficult time.”</p><p>Lachey was the first one to open up about the end of their marriage during a revealing interview with Rolling Stone in 2006.</p><p>“I’ll tell you how I knew my marriage was over. I was told,” he said at the time, claiming that the “With You” singer pulled the plug on their relationship in a limo after the American Music Awards. “She said something about how we hadn’t really been getting along and then said, ‘I think I want a divorce.’ That blindsided me. I basically said, ‘Please, let’s sleep on it.’ But when we woke up the next day, Wednesday morning, she was still sure.”</p><p>The twosome finalized their divorce in June 2006. While Lachey started seeing now-wife <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a> (née Minnillo) shortly after the split, Simpson was linked to<a href=#><strong> Tony Romo </strong></a>and<a href=#><strong> John Mayer</strong></a> before she met now-husband<a href=#><strong> Eric Johnson.</strong></a> In November 2010, both singers announced their engagements to their current spouses within a week of each other.</p><p>“I am extremely, extremely happy for him,” Simpson told <a href=#><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong> </a>at the time. “My mom actually called me and said that everyone was saying that I was ‘saddened.’ I was just in complete shock. I couldn’t be more happy for Nick.”</p><p>A week after Lachey got down on one knee, Simpson<a href=#> confirmed she was set to marry Johnson.</a></p><p>“I will say the same thing I always say: I wish her the very best,” the 98 Degrees singer told Us Weekly at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lachey and the former TRL host, who wed in 2011, share three kids: Camden, Brooklyn and Phoenix. Simpson, for her part, married Johnson in 2014. They share daughters Maxwell and Birdie and son Ace.</p><p>Scroll through to read about the end of Simpson and Lachey’s marriage in their own words:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2F0qKammWjnrqxv86nZKehk6B6ra3CoZyyq12mwrDAxKxkmpqfqsFuwMeeoKtllpa2rbHDZqSaqqKerqixjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaime-pressly-reveals-whats-in-her-son-dezis-lunch-box.html><span>←</span><span>Jaime Pressly Reveals What's in Her Son Dezis Lunch Box</span></a>
