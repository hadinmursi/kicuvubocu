I’m being honest. I mean, it’s nice that it has a fanbase,” <a href=#><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong></a>, who starred in the original 1978 <a href=#>Halloween</a>, told <a href=# rel=noopener>NME </a>about the now-famous movie in October 2018. “I’m not trying to be facetious or cute or clever. Although I do try to do that often… It just bothers me because there’s some feeling that this was some preordained, planned mastermind and that’s just s–t.”</p><p>Curtis explained that director <strong>John Carpenter</strong> would “be the first person to tell you” that they had no clue what type of massive success the film — and its many subsequent sequels — would have.</p><p>“We were making an exploitation slasher movie about killing babysitters. And that’s what it was. Shot in 20 days, shot for nothing. Fast, furious, vicious and what it became really had nothing to do with the intent of the work,” she continued. “The intent of the work was to make a movie and then, as a young filmmaker, make another movie. It became then the thing you could get another job from, not that it was going to become something.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see where some of the biggest horror movie stars are today:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BdvLO%2BzqtkpqemnrJuv9OaqaxlpJ2yr3nAp5tmpp%2BsenN8kG1vamhf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greys-anatomys-jesse-williams-chyler-leigh-kim-ravers-exits-were-depressing-2012215.html><span>←</span><span>Grey's Anatomy's Jesse Williams: Chyler Leigh, Kim Raver's Exits Were &amp;quot;Depressing&amp;quot;</span></a>
