began his film career in his native Australia, where he appeared in various television series.&nbsp;They include&nbsp;</span><span>Guinevere Jones</span><span>&nbsp;(2002),&nbsp;</span><span>Neighbors</span><span>&nbsp;(2002) and&nbsp;</span><span>Marshall</span><span>&nbsp;(2002).&nbsp;He got his first big break in 2004 when he landed the role of sexy but troubled Kim Hyde on the long-running Australian soap.&nbsp;</span><span>home and away</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;The soap had previously served as a launch pad for the careers of other

as&nbsp;</span><span>Star Trek</span><span>&nbsp;(2009) and&nbsp;</span><span>The Perfect Getaway</span><span>&nbsp;(2010).&nbsp;He finally joined the big leagues in 2010 when he landed the popular
