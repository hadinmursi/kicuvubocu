In a better world, the sequel to M3GAN would be MEG4N and Plane would be followed by Ship. Instead, we’re getting M3GAN 2.0 and Plane 2: Stowaway. Sometimes the decision-makers in Hollywood have a great thing going and then they totally, arbitrarily blow it. (For example: watching Barbenheimer save cinema and then punting other blockbuster releases to next year rather than ending the ongoing labor strikes.) There may not be a clearer example of bigwigs beefing it than two upcoming sequels to 2023 movies, both of which had perfect, incredible titles sitting right there only for studios to end up going in a more boring direction.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How many siblings does Gisele Bndchen have?</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>
