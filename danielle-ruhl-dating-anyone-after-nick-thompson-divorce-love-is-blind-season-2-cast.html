And it's going to be even worse when both partners are famous, especially because they met on a reality series like Love Is Blind that gets so much attention. It's possible that Danielle hasn't met anyone that she cares about.</p><p>It's also possible that she hasn't been going on dates consistently. According to E! News, Danielle said in September 2022, "I don't think I'll be ready to date anytime soon. It takes me a long time to get over people. We're still going through the divorce process. Dating is not in my near-term feature right now."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Love Is Blind Contestants Were Allegedly Treated Poorly On Set, But Did Anyone Have A Good Time Filming The Hit Netflix Series?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When watching Danielle Ruhl in season 2 of Love Is Blind, it was clear that she wanted fans to get to know her as a person.

She said, "There's no real closure... Just getting divorced publicly without being able to talk to him, I didn't act the best."</p><p>When asked if they could ever date again, Danielle said "I'm going to be incredibly transparent about how immature I acted." She said "it's one of my biggest regrets." She also noted that if they did date in the future, she would hope that the people in his life would be okay with that because of how she acted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cole Barnett From Love Is Blind Revealed His DMs Exploded With Proposals Following His Time On The Reality Show</a></span></p><p>Both Danielle and Nick have given interviews about how bad filming Love Is Blind was in terms of not having food, water, and mental health resources.

And this is why fans find their divorce so upsetting to hear about.</p><p>In an interview with the podcast Love In Reality, Danielle shared that she felt bonded to Nick in the pods. She said "You could feel the energy on the other side. It was funny, we would say that we would know that it was going to be the other person... I just would have this feeling."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-is-blind-danielle-nick-1.jpg><p>On the same podcast, Danielle explained that when the season 2 Love Is Blind cast were in Mexico, Nick knew that she was feeling anxious and made sure that she was okay.</p><p>Danielle also said of her divorce, "It wasn't just something that happened overnight." She said that they wondered "is this more of an emotional connection?" and "I think we came to the conclusion that we just were not compatible." She mentioned that when thinking about purchasing a home and starting a family, they could tell that things wouldn't work in the long term.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danielle opens up a lot on her Instagram account and fans likely feel that they are following a friend and not a reality star who feels like they are living a very different life than them. Whether she finds love or she and Nick do get back together, it's very likely that Danielle Ruhl will share all about it on her social media and fans will be the first to know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaZmrmtsYyrrKGkXZmutbXNoGSapqmku6Z5wJ%2Brnqpdo7akt4ytn6iloKi8r3nDoq2oqpOaeq271Z5koqtdl7mqusNmqp6Zo6S7bn6MnJisrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-michael-jordan-like-in-real-life-jerk-mean.html><span>←</span><span>Despite Being The Most Loved NBA Player Ever, Michael Jordan Has Been Branded 'A Jerk' By Many Who M</span></a>
