I was just like, 'Are you for real?' How did that even slide by? That is so rude and disrespectful. And I will say it here: completely racist."</p><p>"You are Black,” she said while gesturing at her guest. "You have every right. You are working also, in a professional capacity. I just felt like, now, I wanted to clear that up because I was pissed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carey revealed that she didn't have anyone to talk to about it back then. "I wish I would have called you back when it happened because I was so upset and nobody came to my rescue at that point," she told The Face judge. "But whatever, I can't – it's ignorance."</p><p>Campbell even slammed Bernhard for promoting the Black Lives Matter movement without apologizing for her joke. "I look at these people who are now like, 'Yes, Black Lives Matter', but yes honey, let's really remember what you said," said the supermodel. "Because those things will come back and haunt you. Now you want to backtrack?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Mariah Carey Had To Cut Off Her Jealous’ Mother And How It Affected Her Relationship With Her Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-mariah-carey-confront-sarah-bernhard>How Did Mariah Carey Confront Sarah Bernhard?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52145137-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carey surprised Bernhard and Andy Cohen</a> during their Radio Andy and Sandyland shows on SiriusXM. Before that, the radio hosts were talking about the Obsessed performer doing another interview just down the hall, promoting the upcoming release of her album Caution.</p><p>"You don't love me. You're so mean, Sandra," Carey told the actress before coming into the studio to give Cohen a hug. Bernhard then said: "No ... Mimi ... no, I'm not," said Sandra. "Listen. I played homage to you at a time. Come for one minute, Mimi. Let's bury the hatchet."</p><p>As the five-time Grammy winner sat down to join their live session, Cohen told her, "Sandy loves you!" Bernhard added, "I adore you. Even back in the day, we've talked this through," to which Carey replied: "Well, well, well, no need to go back down that memory lane."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the Glitter star left, Cohen told Bernhard, "So Mimi does not think you like her." The latter brought up her controversial stand-up routine, saying: "I did a funny piece about Mimi years ago, and [Mariah's former manager] Sandy Gallin, god rest his soul, called me and said, 'Please stop doing this piece about Mimi.' I said, 'It's funny!'"</p><p>"Back in the day, where you could use language that you can't use now, I did a thing about Mimi and the men she was with, diving into the water and doing her thing," she continued without acknowledging the joke's racist theme.</p><p>Right after her stand-up, Bernhard was quoted telling the New York Magazine (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via That Grape Juice</a>): "I have carte blanche to use that word from my friend Paul Mooney. I'm a card-carrying white-black girl."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years later, she reflected on the backlash, telling Seattle Weekly: "I think anybody Black who comes to my shows gives me carte blanche to say that because I'm really coming from their place. I'm not some cracker up there…It's so obvious that I'm a part of that culture."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Mariah Carey And Rosie O'Donnell?</a></span></p><h2 id=are-mariah-carey-and-sandra-bernhard-on-good-terms-now>Are Mariah Carey And Sandra Bernhard On Good Terms Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-28-at-6-19-40-pm.png><p>When Carey left Bernhard and Cohen, the former told the Bravo staple that that interaction with the <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> icon "smoothed it" over. "She knows, she said I look good," she noted. "She looks fabulous. She's been through so much and she's still standing and looking terrific."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "I am a little overwhelmed. There are certain people that are really iconic and wonderful. Yeah, she's crazy, but she's so brilliant in her craziness."</p><p>In 2019, during an appearance on Cohen's Watch What Happens Live, Bernhard claimed that she and Carey were now on good terms. But the songstress' interview with Campbell didn't exactly confirm that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoq6ztcChZJyZoprGbq%2FApaOenF2kwrV50pqlnaqRYq%2Bmvs2hmKucXZu8s3nBnqCnn12isqK6jK2mZqCVp3qlwdGipaBlkaN6qrrTnqmvoZWsfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mandy-moore-dyes-her-hair-blonde-with-9-box-color-pic.html><span>←</span><span>Mandy Moore Dyes Her Hair Blonde With $9 Box Color: Pic</span></a>
