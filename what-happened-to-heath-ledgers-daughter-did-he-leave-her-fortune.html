As a result of his success, Ledger was able to make enough money that <strong>he left behind a sizable fortune</strong>. Sadly for Ledger's loved ones, there was drama surrounding the actor's estate which quickly found its way into the public eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/heath-ledger-and-matilda-ledger.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Ledger passed away in January 2008, The New York Times published an article revealing the sad news. As a part of that piece, the publication revealed that Ledger's only child, his daughter Matilda Ledger, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just over two years old at the time of her father's passing</a>.</p><p>Ideally, anyone who has a child should have an up-to-date will to take care of them if anything happens. In reality, however, many parents procrastinate about that kind of thing for understandable reasons. After all, who wants to think about losing their life and leaving a child they love behind?</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-mick-jagger-and-keith-richards-really-share-a-girlfriend-who-mothered-some-of-the-guitarist-s-children_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Mick Jagger And Keith Richards Really Share A Girlfriend Who Mothered Some Of The Guitarist's Children?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Anita Pallenberg dated Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and gave birth to several of the guitarist's children.</span><p>By the time Heath Ledger passed away, <strong>he had a will in place</strong>. However, Forbes published an article using Ledger's estate as an example of a kind of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mistake that everyone should avoid at all costs</a>.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Heath Ledger left behind an estate that was worth a lot of money. The website reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the estate Ledger left behind would be worth $16 million</a> as of January 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reason why <strong>Ledger's will is a cautionary tale</strong> is that the actor never updated his estate plans after his daughter was born. That meant that none of the actor's fortune was left to his daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/heath-ledger-at-candy-screening-at-tribeca-grand-hotel.jpg><p>When Ledger passed away, his will stipulated that <strong>his entire fortune would be left to the actor's parents and three sisters</strong>. After Ledger's passing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his father released a statement about the family's plans for how to handle the actor's fortune</a>.</p><p>"Matilda is our absolute priority, and Michelle is an integral part of our family. They will be taken care of and that's how Heath would want it to be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In theory, that statement should have put to rest any concerns about whether Matilda Ledger would receive the fortune her father left behind.

According to that piece, Ledger's father, Kim Ledger, had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previously been in charge of a different estate and completely mishandled it</a>.</p><p>While speaking to People, Heath Ledger's uncle, Mike Ledger, claimed the actor's father severely mismanaged an estate. According to Mike Ledger, Kim Ledger was in charge of his father's estate and bungled it so badly that it was "plunged into enormous debt".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People's article further claimed that the actor's uncles were asking for <strong>tangible proof that Matilda Ledger would receive her father's fortune</strong>. Furthermore, the uncles stated that they wouldn't receive any money if Kim Ledger was removed or not. “Our only vested interest is to assure that Matilda is well looked after.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/michelle-williams-and-matila-ledger.jpg><p>Following the drama, Ledger's family got a spokesperson to speak on their behalf. That spokesperson, Adene Cassidy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked for the public fighting to end</a> during an appearance on Channel Seven's Sunrise program.</p><p>"It is sad at this extremely difficult time in our lives, while we are grieving the loss of our beloved son, that estranged family members publicly discuss matters they have not been privy to in the past or now. We hope for Matilda's sake they will remain dignified."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In September 2008, People published an article about what happened to Ledger's estate.

That was the plan from the moment my boy passed away. There was never any question about the fact that Heath's estate would go to Matilda. Never a question.
