When his condition didn't improve, despite multiple hospital visits, doctors thought something might be wrong with his liver. Last week, they diagnosed him with stage-four colon cancer.</p><p>A stage-four diagnosis generally means the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Doctors are weighing Givens' treatment options now; his rep tells TMZ they expect a decision soon. In the meantime, the Stallionaires rapper is being cared for at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.</p><p>Fellow VH1 reality star <strong>Ray J</strong> <a href=#>tweeted</a> about the news on March 19.
