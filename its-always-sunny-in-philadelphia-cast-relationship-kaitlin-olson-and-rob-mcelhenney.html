In fact, according to reports, there have been several <a href=#>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes that almost got the show canceled</a>. Thankfully, however, fans love the show so much that <a href=#>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has become the longest-running comedy in TV history</a> instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Are Still Talking About This Episode Of 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia'</a></span></p><p>While there are many reasons why It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has so many fans, one element that has contributed to the show’s success is that the people who make it are very open. After all, the show’s stars have a long history of telling fans what goes on <a href=#>behind the scenes of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a>. For example, it has recently been revealed that something happened early on in Rob McElhenney and Kaitlin Olson’s relationship that easily could have ended things.</p><h2 id=what-happened-in-kaitlin-olson-and-rob-mcelhenney-rsquo-s-relationship>What Happened In Kaitlin Olson And Rob McElhenney’s Relationship?</h2><p>Over the last several years, it has become very clear that podcasts are becoming much more of a force in the world. After all, there is a reason why <a href=#>Joe Rogan</a> was paid a fortune for his podcast and he has become one of the most important pop culture figures in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the fact that podcasts are becoming more and more popular each year, it is becoming common for mainstream stars to embrace the medium. For example, three of New Girl’s main stars, Rob Lowe from Parks and Recreation, as well as Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey from The Office all have podcasts about their hit shows. Evidently not wanting to be left behind, Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, and Charlie Day now host The Always Sunny Podcast and Kaitlin Olson has appeared on the show as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Aren't Jake Johnson And Max Greenfield On The 'New Girl' Podcast?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During each episode of “The Always Sunny Podcast”, the hosts talk about their current lives and tell stories about the show that made them all stars. Since It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has always been willing to tackle some extreme subjects, it likely won’t surprise anyone that the podcast about the show also doesn’t pull any punches.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Top 10 Celebrity-Hosted Podcasts (According To Spotify)</a></span></p><p>For anyone who wants to know how revealing “The Always Sunny Podcast” can be, all they have to do is listen to its twentieth episode. Almost twenty minutes into the podcast episode, Rob McElhenney begins to talk about when he and his wife and co-star Kaitlin Olson began dating. To the surprise of everyone, after giving a basic timeline about when his relationship began, McElhenney suddenly reveals a very embarrassing story about his past with Olson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Rob McElhenney, during the early stages of his relationship with Kaitlin Olson, he had far too much to drink one night. The next morning when they both woke up, Olson remarked that he’d sweated a lot overnight. Unfortunately, Olson’s assumption about the situation turned out to be wrong as the reality is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McElhenney relieved himself in his sleep</a> with Olson in the bed beside him.</p><h2 id=how-rob-mcelhenney-knew-he-wanted-to-marry-kaitlin-olson>How Rob McElhenney Knew He Wanted To Marry Kaitlin Olson</h2><p>As Rob McElhenney revealed that embarrassing story during the aforementioned podcast episode, he made it clear that not only was the bed wet, Kaitlin Olson was too. Needless to say, many people would have been so grossed out if they were in Olson’s shoes in that situation that they would have broken up with McElhenney. Thankfully for McElhenney, as he revealed in the aforementioned podcast, Olson had a very different reaction to his overnight accident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She thought it was the funniest thing that could possibly happen”. During the conversation about Rob McElhenney's overnight accident, he was asked about what Kaitlin Olson’s reaction to the situation meant to him. In response, McElhenney claims he knew Olson was the woman for him after that. “I was like, we’re going to get, I’m marrying this chick. That’s what sealed the deal of us deciding to get married and since then we’ve lived in wedded bliss.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that Rob McElhenney is known for his sense of humor, it isn’t completely clear if he was serious when he said he knew he wanted to marry Kaitlin Olson after that. However, it certainly seems likely that McElhenney knew he truly had a partner in Olson after that incident. Either way, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McElhenney and Olson walked down the aisle in 2008</a>, they now have two kids together, and they seem very happy all of these years later.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>A Look Inside Rob McElhenney And Kaitlin Olson's Marriage</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigratdlrm4rdisZKytnqPGbrXNZqehoZyWsaa4z6GgmmWTlsC1edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWSkmZmpuaq6jKijrKeeYq6vsIyrpptlnZiyrbTEp6WesV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-was-lisa-marie-presleys-son-benhamin-keough-depression-death.html><span>←</span><span>The Tragic Truth About Benjamin Keough's Short Life As Lisa Marie Presley's Son And His Struggle Wit</span></a>
