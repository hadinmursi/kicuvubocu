The 2003 film&nbsp;revolves around magazine columnist Andie Anderson, who is assigned a story about how to get a man to break up with you in just 10 days. Meanwhile, McConaughey’s Ben Barry makes a bet that he can get any woman to fall in love with him in the same amount of time.</p><p>In August 2020, the Golden Globe winner told Elle that she’s <a href=#>thought about how a modern sequel to the film would look.</a></p><p>“I’ve always thought about what [McConaughey] and I’s characters would be now, if we were still together,” the&nbsp;Music actress&nbsp;said in the interview. “We probably would have gotten married with kids.
