Following his work as a model, Pitt took on acting classes and after some TV work, he would become a star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most would agree, his look was a big part of his success and some might argue, it still is. In truth, the 57-year-old is an ageless wonder.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Before Becoming Famous, Brad Pitt And Johnny Depp Appeared Together On This Show</a></span></p><p>Despite the handsomeness, which is admired by millions worldwide, Pitt is no longer concerned with his looks. In fact, according to sources, <a href=#>he doesn't even want his daughter to walk in his footsteps</a>, in the world of modeling.</p><p>“Hollywood is already a highly competitive, crazy world, and he doesn’t want Shiloh to be under all the extra scrutiny. Brad has pledged to keep an extremely close eye on the situation and wants to be updated on Shiloh’s modeling plans every step of the way,” the source said.</p><p>Pitt has his focus elsewhere these days, as he revealed alongside Esquire. It seems like the older he gets, the more he craves simplicity in his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pitt-doesn-39-t-want-to-be-a-human-billboard-anymore>Pitt Doesn't Want To Be A Human Billboard Anymore</h2><p>“I like simplicity. I like the details in the stitching, the way it feels. If anything, that’s the only divining rod I have.”</p><p>Those are Pitt's words alongside Esquire. <a href=#>The actor is focused on the simple life</a>, and that includes no longer being a walking billboard for other companies. He's only focused on companies he believes in.</p><p>"I don’t want to look ostentatious, but if you come close, you notice. I like how the lining feels. It’s those details that are important to me. It’s too exhausting to follow trends. And I despise billboards; I just don’t want to be a billboard.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Call Brad Pitt ‘Trash’ For Working With Harvey Weinstein Despite What Angelina Jolie Went Through</a></span></p><p>If Pitt is to endorse anything, it is a product he has full trust in. Instead of backing a prestigious clothing brand, his efforts are to help the things he actually uses such as coffee and the brand, De’Longhi.</p><p>“I am a serious, professional, committed coffee drinker,” he says. “Usually a three-cappuccino drinker in the morning, and depending on the work in the afternoon, I might switch over to an espresso.”</p><p>"When you have confidence in your product, you don’t have to shove it down people’s throats."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It appears as though Pitt is much wiser and according to the same interview alongside Esquire, he's also crankier.</p><h2 id=older-and-crankier>Older And Crankier</h2><p>Simple and sleek, is what Pitt looks for in his clothes these days. He's okay with a shirt lasting 30 years, as long as it is quality. He has changed in regards to his look and a lot of that has to do with his older age.</p><p>"You get older, you get crankier, and comfort becomes more important. I think it’s as simple as that.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Brad Pitt Was Almost Canceled By Hollywood As An Extra</a></span></p><p>Among the biggest importance is his health and happiness behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though no matter what he does, he'll always be regarded as a heartthrob. The likes of Kaley Cuoco admitted the actor gets better with age. A sentiment echoed by lots of other stars. It seems like the older he gets, the better he is.</p><h2 id=the-simple-life>The Simple Life</h2><p>Alongside GQ, <a href=#>Pitt was interviewed detailing his new way of life</a>, following his recovery. Pitt started off in this world living the simple farm life with his family - it seems as though he's reverted to those elements in recent years.</p><p>"I get up every morning and I make a fire. When I go to bed, I make a fire, just because—it makes me feel life. I just feel life in this house.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The days of a packed house with constant chaos are done with, Pitt has more of an appreciation for creating in peace.</p><p>"I've been going to a friend's sculpting studio, spending a lot of time over there. My friend [Thomas Houseago] is a serious sculptor. They've been kind. I've literally been squatting in there for a month now. I'm taking a shit on their sanctity."</p><p>Turns out, Leonardo DiCaprio also took part in the sculpting hobby alongside Pitt. We can say both A-listers have changed their lives dramatically these days.</p><p>Though, despite the change and new attitudes, they remain among the more polished stars, whether they believe so or not. I guess what we can take away from Brad is, less is more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To Kaley Cuoco's Obsession With Brad Pitt</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVYsSpxYybqZqcXaW2tcCMnaaeq56peqSt0Z5kmpqfqsFuwMeeZLCZqWK1pnnLqKakq12Wu7q5zqucaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gurshabad-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-571048-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gurshabad Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
