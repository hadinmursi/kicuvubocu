For more than a decade, the reality star has been turning heads with her curves at every event she’s attended and all over her social media.</p><p>The KKW Beauty founder started<a href=#> showing off her stylish figure</a> when she first gained attention as <a href=#><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></a>‘s devoted sidekick, donning formfitting numbers on the red carpet, gowns with high leg slits and itty-bitty bikinis at the beach. As her own stardom began to grow with her family’s reality series, <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>, the California native eventually landed on a signature look.</p><p>Kardashian married rapper <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> in May 2014, nearly one year after welcoming her first child, daughter <a href=#>North</a>.

You do get comfortable and then you start to get off track a little bit but I’ve kind of like pumped it up a little bit, just started to stay focused and follow the Atkins diet again. I feel like I lost another last few pounds that I really had to lose so that makes me happy.”</p><p>The SKIMS founder and the “Stronger” rapper share two more children, daughter <a href=#>Chicago</a> and son <a href=#>Psalm</a>, who were <a href=#>welcomed via surrogate</a> in January 2018 and May 2019, respectively.&nbsp;After spending time wrangling her four little ones, Kardashian committed herself to getting into tip-top shape ahead of the 2019 holidays.</p><p>“Kim is really focused on <a href=#>getting back to her goal weight</a> and to a place where she feels totally fit and comfortable with her body,” a source told Us Weekly exclusively after the social media mogul gained “18 additional pounds” before November 2019. “She has been working out very diligently, so she can <a href=#>feel like ‘herself’ again</a> and wear the items she wants to without worrying about how they will fit.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The reality star <a href=#>filed for divorce from West in February 2021</a> after six years of marriage.
