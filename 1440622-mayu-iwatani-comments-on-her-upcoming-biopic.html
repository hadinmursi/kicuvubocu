Rizu Kimoto noted a comparison to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NJPW STRONG</a> Women’s Champion <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Giulia</a>. The latter is on a title defense streak of eight wins whereas Mayu only has three. The IWGP and STRONG Women’s belts both allow STARDOM talent to compete with the best female wrestlers overseas, but Mayu has only defended her belt once in the United States. She then responds, “I don’t grow if I watch the same matches all the time, so my goal this year is to be the IWGP Women’s Champion and always have matches that will allow me to go beyond my best matches” (translation via Google Translate).</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As previously reported</a>, Mayu will defend her IWGP Women’s Championship against fellow STARDOM wrestler <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mina Shirakawa</a> at a future date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtZ29qYmK6osXUZqCwmaSWu6p5wqikpp2eqcBuu81mn56qXaq9pLvMoqWgZZKevLG1wg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-wahlberg-reveals-that-hes-gained-20-pounds-in-3-weeks-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Wahlberg Reveals That He's Gained 20 Pounds in 3 Weeks: Pics</span></a>
