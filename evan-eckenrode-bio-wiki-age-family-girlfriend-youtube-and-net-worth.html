Evan had a funny side to him which was identified by Logan. Logan convinced Evan to create a YouTube channel in order to showcase his talent to the world. Evan then created the channel and named it ‘Dwarf Mamba.’</p><p>Initially, Evan was worried about the response of his viewers. He thought being a dwarf might make him a laughingstock. But his flaw turned out to be a blessing in disguise. His efforts to showcase his talent to the world through a social media platform encouraged and inspired others. Evan then decided to make videos that specifically focus on dwarfism. Thanks to his wit, he also made people laugh through his videos.</p><p>He then collaborated with Logan Paul and together they came up with many comedy sketches in no time, Evan was a star. However, his parents were not happy with his career choice. They did not understand the concept of making videos on YouTube and thought it was some lowly profession. But when they saw people approaching their son for interviews and autographs, they were convinced.</p><p>From then, there was no looking back for Evan. He posted many comedy videos on his channel and Logan Paul was a part of many of these videos. One of their popular videos is titled as ‘Smuggling a dwarf to Paris in a Suitcase!’ In the video, Logan literally packed Evan inside a large suitcase and traveled to Paris.</p><p>Evan too has been featured in a lot of videos that have been posted by Logan on his YouTube channel. Some of them are ‘Dwarf mamba gets stuck inside a pumpkin,’ ‘Dwarf attached to 12-foot paper airplane,’ ‘our first fight as roommates,’ ‘Logan Paul vs Dwarf Mamba Vine battle’ and many more. Evan posted a video after winning gold in Dwarf Olympics. In the video, he shared his thoughts of winning the gold with his fans.</p><p>He was then featured in a music video of the song, ‘Post Malittle – Why Dwarfism.’ This song was dedicated to dwarfs all over the world. Evan went on to become famous on other social media platforms like Instagram and Vine. Logan continued his collaboration with Evan on Vine. Evan’s extremely funny vine videos have helped his channel earn a host of followers.</p><p>In one of his vine videos, he was seen making fun of himself for being a dwarf.
