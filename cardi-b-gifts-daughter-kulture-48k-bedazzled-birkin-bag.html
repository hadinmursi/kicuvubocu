Apparently, the little one was so obsessed with a purse there, that Cardi took it upon herself to get her daughter a designer version.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“In typical Cardi way, she didn’t get that bag, but she called me instead to try to replicate that rainbow on a Birkin for Kulture,” Porter told the publication. Fast forward through 100 hours of work and 30,000 Swarovski crystals, and the toddler has a custom Hermés in-hand.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>That’s not the only bling the little one is rocking in the photo though. She also has a diamond charm necklace estimated at $150,000, according to <strong>Kathryn Money</strong> of Brilliant Earth.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The piece of jewelry, which was designed by Eliantte, features pave diamonds and five charms: a Birkin bag, a Chanel symbol, a Minnie Mouse design, the letter ‘K,’ and a heart wrapped in a pink bow.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Given the sheer amount of bling on Kulture, it’s no surprise that fans took the comments by storm to share their thoughts on the trendy tot.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“All this drip,” a fan wrote with a slew of fire emojis. “Y’all so fly. That rainbow Birkin is so hot,” another said. Someone else chimed in: “Her hair, the birkin, the necklace YOU.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Cardi, who is expecting her second child with Offset, isn’t one to shy away from dripping her daughter in designer duds. Shopping sprees are a fairly regular occurrence.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>In April, the “WAP” singer bought her daughter several designer bags. “Ooo, I went crazy shopping. All for Kulture though, nothing is mine — all KK,” she said in an Instagram Stories, showing off four Chanel boxes, three Dior boxes and a Dolce & Gabbana bag.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Related Post:</b><a href=#> <span>Our Favorite Stylish Designer Tote Bags&nbsp;</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5ius7DIZplmn5mbwbR5w5qsoKCkmr9ut9Slq66qlWKBebeMm5ydmaqvuaawjJugq6OZo3qjrcZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1379924-cameron-grimes-long-hair-keeps-him-grounded.html><span>←</span><span>Cameron Grimes Says Having Long Hair Keeps Him Grounded</span></a>
