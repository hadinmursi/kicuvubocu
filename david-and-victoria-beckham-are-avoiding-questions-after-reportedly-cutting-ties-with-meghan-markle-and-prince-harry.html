Though David and Victoria were present for the royal couple’s 2018 nuptials, they didn’t extend an invite to their son’s 2022 wedding to American heiress Nicola Peltz.</p><p>Speculation that Harry and Meghan believed David and Victoria were spreading stories about to them to the press began circulating last month.</p><p>“Every night [Harry and Meghan] scoured the internet to read the newspaper reports and the trolls’ postings on social media,” royal expert Tom Bower claimed in his book Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the War Between the Windsors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Kate Middleton Jealous Of Meghan Markle’s Career?</a></span></p><p>“Irrationally, they grouped the two together and fed each other’s frenzy about the media,” he went on. “Convinced that as champions of goodness they were being persecuted by mendacity and racism, they felt victimized by the mildest criticism.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bower said that Meghan “suspected Victoria Beckham of indiscretion,” which led to Harry confronting David. “Outraged, Beckham’s truthful denials damaged their relationship,” the royal expert went on, appearing to reference the infamous phone call that severed their friendship for good.</p><p>For now, neither the Beckhams nor Windors have commented on the suspected feuds between their families. But this isn’t the <a href=#>only stark claim that Bower makes in his book</a>. He goes into detail about Harry and Meghan’s relationship with his family, claiming that Meghan made Duchess Kate Middleton cry during dress fittings for her wedding. Moreover, Bower says Queen Elizabeth was relieved when Meghan decided not to return to the U.K. for Prince Phillip’s 2021 funeral.</p><p>Although Harry and Meghan may have relocated to California to escape the publicity they were facing in his native U.K., it appears drama continues to follow them wherever they go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqiusNmraKbpKS%2Fqq2Mm5yco5iWum6t0Z5kmq6fnrGqusZmqK6do6m2sLrSZpifrJWnerOxz6iprZ2UocZur9Stq6Kml2LBqrHSZq6irJhiuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsYyapZ1loKe2r6%2FEZp%2BaqqKufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dave-season-3-episode-9-recap-dream-girl-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dave Recap: Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</span></a>
