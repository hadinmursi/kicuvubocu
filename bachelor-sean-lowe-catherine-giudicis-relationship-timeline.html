I knew that one of the reasons I was probably chosen was because I was Filipino,” Giudici wrote via Instagram in June 2020. “I counted myself out to be his fiancée because of what I assumed Sean liked.<a href=#> I thought I was there just to check a box</a>, but I ended up with so much more. I became present with the process and as he started noticing me for who I really was, I allowed this experience to open myself up to the possibility of being fully loved and appreciated for all that I was. I ended up getting to represent a mixed race community, I found Christ (I LOVE my testimony!) and marrying the most amazing man I’ve ever known. I’d say doing this show was one of the best things that ever happened to me.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for a full timeline of Lowe and Giudici’s relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6Kvx56jqKpdqLKiuoylprCdXZiutbTEq6CnnV2ctrawyJygrGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tbXMnqOippVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ariana-grande-gets-hit-with-angel-wings-at-victorias-secret-show-gif-2014312.html><span>←</span><span>Ariana Grande Gets Hit With Angel Wings at Victoria's Secret Show: GIF</span></a>
