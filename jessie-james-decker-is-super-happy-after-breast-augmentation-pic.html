I always say, you do you and do what makes you feel confident and sexy. #YOLO.”</p><p>The former reality star, who married <a href=#><strong>Eric Decker</strong></a> in June 2013 has previously <a href=#>talked about not wanting to add to their family</a>. The couple are parents of Vivianne, 7, Eric, 5, and Forrest, 3.</p><p>“I’m going to be real with you, he has a doctor’s appointment to go be done with it, to get snipped,” she exclusively told Us Weekly in January about Eric, 34, getting a vasectomy. “I don’t know how I feel about it. I keep thinking, ‘He’s going to wake up that morning to go to the hospital and I’m just going to cry.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the time, the Eric & Jessie: Game On alum wasn’t sure if she was ready for such a “permanent” decision. She’s since <a href=#>confirmed that the Decker family is officially full</a>, however.</p><p>“This photo was emotional for me because I knew it was my last photo being pregnant and my last baby being born,” the Kittenish creator captioned a family photo via Instagram <a href=#>on her son Forrest’s</a> birthday in March. “So I really took it all in. I loved getting to know my babies while growing inside of me each time and learning their personalities, which turned out to be true when they came out. I sure do love being a Mommy. Happy birthday eve little wild child Forrest. Life is better with you in it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajnaOotqZ5yZqknqtdmbKkt8SrZKKrXajCsbHRZp%2BaqKCueqKy056pZpqimq60wIyarKCllaPBosDIqKVmqJmYfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeffrey-epstein-net-worth-biography-wiki-age-parents-family-photos-or-more.html><span>←</span><span>Jeffrey Epstein Net Worth, Biography, Wiki, Age, Parents, Family, photos or more</span></a>
