When Modern Family star Sarah Hyland stepped on the scale on Monday, February 26, the number read 92.8 pounds, 49 percent body fat. The measurements were so bizarre that the 27-year-old shared it on her Instagram Stories that night.
“Definition of #skinnyfat,” she captioned the picture. “Or my scale is broken.”&nbsp;
But Hyland didn’t seem too concerned. In the next clip she was seen spooning Jif peanut butter out of the jar while watching The Bachelor."><meta name=author content="Tandra Barner"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
