Daniel Cambrourelis-Haskins, 19, was found dead at about 3:15 p.m. the day after he went missing.&nbsp;</p><p>The death is under investigation by the Worcester District Attorney’s Office and the Milford Police Department.</p><p>Cambrouelis-Haskins had last been heard from shortly after 6 p.m. Monday when he called his mother to inform her that his bicycle had a flat tire and his cellphone was dying, the deputy said.</p><p>Haskins is described as 6 foot tall, with facial hair. He was last seen wearing a puffy beige coat, khaki pants, boots, and a green helmet.</p><p>According to the deputy, he told his mom that he was returning home off the bike path.&nbsp;</p><p>Cambrourelis-Haskins left his home Monday morning but was supposed to return by 5 p.m. His <a href=#>family</a> grew concerned when his phone call was disconnected, and he did not return home.&nbsp;</p><p>The 19-year-old boy was found dead by authorities in a wooded area of Milford.</p><p>The district attorney’s office said Cambrourelis-Haskins’ death appears to be an isolated incident and that there is no danger to the public.</p><p>On Monday, Haskins was last seen alive pushing a bicycle with a flat tire along a bike trail in Milford. He was reported missing by his mother in the late hours of Monday.&nbsp;</p><p>Cambrourelis-Haskins’ cellphone pinged off a cell tower behind Garrets Convenience Store on Cedar Street in Milford when he talked to his mother.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 40 police officers, a dozen police dogs, and their handlers were taking part in the search, and four drones were being used to search from the air.</p><p>The Massachusetts State Police joined officers from Milford and Hopkinton and search teams from the Central Massachusetts and Northeast Massachusetts Law Enforcement Councils, the deputy said.</p><p>According to Milford police, Cambrourelis-Haskins had an eating disorder. He also suffered from mental health issues and commented to his family about living in the woods.</p><p>Haskins’ bike helmet was retrieved from where his body was found.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities have yet to figure out a cause of death, but it does not look like Haskins was murdered.&nbsp;</p><p>Haskins’s death looks like another case of neglected upbringing. This case highlights the importance of checking our children’s mental health.&nbsp;</p><p>Mental health issues can push a person over the edge in no time.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5yKyqoqaXYrWwvMqipa2nnmK6orqMqaaloZOaerSxwKuaoWWTpLqmv4ytpmaZnmLCr7LOq6uuppGpsm6xzZ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mar-urista-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-634539-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mar Urista Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
