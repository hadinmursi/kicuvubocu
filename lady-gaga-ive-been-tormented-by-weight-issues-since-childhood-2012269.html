Gratitude mostly. Seeing you post photos of things on your bodies and in your minds that you feel society tells you you should be ashamed of. You are showing them you have no shame," she wrote on her <a href=#>website</a> Tuesday. "Watching you all create a safe space online for people to be compassionate is the greatest gift you could ever give me."</p><p>The 26-year-old singer <a href=#>started</a> the "revolution" with her fans after she posted photos of herself in yellow lingerie with the caption, "[I've battled] bulimia and anorexia since I was 15."</p><p>Gaga continued to open about about her history with eating disorders by writing, "My weight/loss/gain since i was child has tormented me. No amount of help has ever healed my pain about it. But you have," she wrote. "My boyfriend [Taylor Kinney] prefers me curvier. When I eat and am healthy and not so worried about my looks, I'm happy. Happier than I've ever been. I am not going to go on a psycho-spree because of scrutiny."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The pop star's open discussion on body image comes after a recent radio interview with <strong>Elvis Duran</strong>, in which she <a href=#>admitted</a> to being on a diet "because I gained, like, 25 pounds."</p><p>But the Grammy-winning singer says she's happy with the her weight right now.</p><p>"This is who I am. And I am proud at any size," she wrote. "And I love you, and want you to be proud in any form you may take as well. Please don't look for kindness in critics, go where you know the gold is. Here, in our hearts. Love, Gaga."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZSueqitxppkoq6VYq%2Bmsc1mq6iqnZq7tbHDZpmyZaeatqi002agrKulmsBuv8inmp5lk522rbDHqKadZWJlfnN%2BlXJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenneth-chenault-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-332914-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kenneth Chenault Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
