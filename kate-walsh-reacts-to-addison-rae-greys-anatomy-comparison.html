She revealed exclusively to Us Weekly in February that she <a href=#>would like to return</a> to the long-running ABC drama.</p><p>“Of course! I mean, I’m here in western Australia so it would be a big trip so I’d have to see. But, yeah, I’m always open to it. I’m here,” she explained. “I couldn’t be further away from Los Angeles right now. But maybe Addison could call in or Zoom in.”</p><p>Season 17 of Grey’s Anatomy has already seen the <a href=#>return of several beloved characters</a>, including <a href=#><strong>Patrick Dempsey</strong></a>’s Derek Shepherd and <a href=#><strong>T.R. Knight</strong></a>’s George O’Malley. “It’s been incredible,” Walsh told Us of watching the <a href=#>reunions</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for the possibility that the <a href=#>show could end soon</a>, the <a href=#>Emily in Paris</a> star noted that it would be “an end of an era” no matter when it concludes. “I mean, it’s such an epic piece of my life,” she said. “It’s been such an incredible run and has changed so many lives and has certainly changed my life. Whatever they decide I think obviously is a creative decision, but I was thrilled to be a part of it.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rae has become a <a href=#>star in her own right through TikTok</a>. “I’m truly thankful for the platform my followers have given me,” she exclusively told Us in July 2020.</p><p>However, the influencer is still figuring out how to navigate the spotlight. “I am working on realizing that my worth does not come from other people’s words. … I’ve learned a lot,” she said. “But I think most importantly I have learned that I am more sensitive yet stronger than I thought.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSaerity6yfZqqVlrC1v4ytpmaZlJm2tLvNZqmanV2cv6bF0maYp5mkpLq6ecKopKmZop7AsLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justine-ezarik-aka-ijustines-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Justine Ezarik aka iJustines Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
