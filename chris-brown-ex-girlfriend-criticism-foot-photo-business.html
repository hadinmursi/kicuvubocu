"There's a stigma around OF, but there's literally chefs, musicians, yoga instructors, etc. on there." <strong>But this is not her only business, and Tran has worked hard to establish herself and her career. </strong>This includes working as an actress on the drama series Claws, and being signed to Wilhelmina Models.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before embracing a career in the entertainment industry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tran was a personal shopper</a>, and she discussed this in an interview with W magazine in 2017. "It's influenced me to keep working hard," she said of how her job in fashion influenced her. "To go from where I started in a department store to acting is such a big leap for me. It motivates me to push myself harder and succeed, to understand that life is unexpected, and to be ready to handle whatever comes your way.

In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tran addressed why this relationship was not good for her</a> during an appearance on The Angie Martinez Show. "I was trying to find my way and trying to make it through somehow, one day at a time," she said. "And now, looking back, I'm like, 'Girl, you were going through it.'

"Now I know how to love myself and do for me … I wasn't working out, not eating good, not drinking water, smoking too much weed."</p><p>But she reflected on her relationship with wisdom, noting how she had grown and how the "rock bottom moments" motivated her to change.</p><p>Interestingly, in March 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brown made headlines for liking one of Tran's Instagram posts</a> (a picture of her looking gorgeous).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqHqjvs6wpWadqGK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZeqS%2ByK2gnKGjonqnu86tZKmgn6m8bq7UrKCnnaOofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cheyenne-emanuel-allegations-what-happened-to-caesar-daughter-from-black-ink-2.html><span>←</span><span>Cheyenne Emanuel Allegations, What Happened To Caesar Daughter From Black Ink?</span></a>
