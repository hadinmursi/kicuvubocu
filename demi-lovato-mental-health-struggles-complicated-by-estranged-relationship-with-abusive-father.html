My father dealt with mental illness. He wasn't able to function very well in society." Lovato herself has faced the challenges of bipolar disorder, and she has been candid about her battles with self-harm and eating disorders.</p><p>In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lovato reflected on her complex relationship with her birth father, recognizing its impact on her subsequent relationships and behaviors.</p><p>"It caused relationship issues and certain behaviors in the future. I learned the reasoning behind those behaviors was because of my dad," she shared.</p><p>In the premiere of her 2021 documentary, Dancing With the Devil, Lovato bravely opened up about how her strained connection with her father influenced her upbringing. "... I longed for that relationship with him. Then I resented him because he was an addict and an alcoholic, and he was abusive to my mom. So I cut him out because I felt like it was causing more harm than good having him in my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52406557.jpg><p>Lovato has attributed much of her trauma to her fractured relationship with her father and the trauma of witnessing abuse inflicted on her mother.

She revealed the conflict she felt at her father's passing, given his abusive behavior. "... He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person.
