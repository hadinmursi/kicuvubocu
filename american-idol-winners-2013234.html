Since it initially aired in June 2002, <a href=#>American Idol</a> has made many dreams come true for its winners.</p><p>“When I was a little girl … if you had asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up, I would have told you I wanted to be a famous country music singer,” season 4 winner <a href=#><strong>Carrie Underwood</strong></a> told fans during her concert at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville in September 2019. “As I got older, dreams tend to give way to practicalities, so I started going to school to get a real job. One day there was an open door, and I walked through it and my life was changed forever.”</p><p>Underwood is not the only past winner <a href=#>whose life was changed after appearing on American Idol</a>. For <a href=#><strong>Jordin Sparks</strong></a>, the experience was even more unique because she was a fan of the hit competition show first.</p><p>“I was such a huge fan of Idol that I was more excited to audition for that than to get my driver’s license,” Sparks told AZCentral in August 2017. “That’s how a big a fan I was.”</p><p>The season 6 winner admitted that <a href=#>being on a show like American Idol was overwhelming</a>. Following her win, Sparks suffered from “bad anxiety and panic attacks” as a result of how quickly things changed in her life.</p><p>“The down side is a lot of sacrifice and being alone — not lonely, but alone,” she reflected. “I’m a huge family person and not being able to make some things — that’s not easy. But my family has been completely understanding and they are so great and supportive. There are times when I want to go to see my nieces and [think], ‘Crap, I have an interview and I can’t go.’ So it’s hard, but I’ve learned how to balance things. It took a while, but I think I’ve got the hang of it and I’m happy about it now.”</p><p>Season 1’s winner, <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a>, still puts in the work every day following her success on the hit singing show.</p><p>“18 years ago today was the finale of the first season of American Idol and it changed my life! I’m still hustlin 18 years later because I know I am blessed to have the opportunities and I still love my purpose!” Clarkson tweeted in September 2020 on the anniversary of her big win.</p><p>For <a href=#><strong>Chayce Beckham</strong></a>, that hustle for more was bound to happen no matter what.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ll record a record, put the record out, and go on tour to meet all my fans in every state that I can,” the season 19 winner told the Daily Press one month before his May 2021 win. “I’ll keep my name relevant, and I won’t stop doing what I’m doing. I think it’s a pretty simple formula, but there are so many variables to it. It just depends on your consistency and your drive, which will determine the outcome of your success.”</p><p>Scroll down to see which singers have <a href=#>beat thousands of other contenders</a> to win a recording contract on American Idol:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWuqa%2ByJyYp2WZmbytedaipaedoqh6c3yQbGlsbF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drake-birthday-bryan-cranston-aaron-paul-bartend-breaking-bad.html><span>←</span><span> 'Breaking Bad' Stars Bryan Cranston &amp;amp; Aaron Paul Bartend Drakes 37</span></a>
