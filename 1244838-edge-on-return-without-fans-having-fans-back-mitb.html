It certainly wasn’t what any of us had expected.”</p><p>“It was all so strange…but I wasn’t going to complain. The world was going through a pandemic. Our job was to try and make something entertaining.”</p><p>Of course, “The Rated-R Superstar” also explained that competing in an empty arena at WWE WrestleMania 36 and several other shows, without any fans in attendance, “sucked.” But moving forward, he’ll get to have the run he’s been dreaming of since he was forced to retire in 2011.</p><p>“This is the stretch I was looking for 10 years ago,” said Edge. “I know this window is not open for a long time, but I get the chance to end my career the way I always wanted to, and I finally get to do it in front of a crowd.”</p><p>WWE&nbsp;<a href=#>Money In The Bank</a> will be the next chapter of this story; there, Edge will challenge Roman Reigns for the WWE Universal Championship. Regardless of the outcome, Edge will surely soak in the atmosphere on Sunday night and beyond.</p><p>“We’re back,” said Edge. “I’m going to enjoy every crowd reaction, and that’s only been amplified with the pandemic. We’re getting crowds back, and we get to do what we do in front of a crowd. I’m so thrilled to be here, and I can’t wait for what happens next.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFta3FraGKypbPEZqanZaKawba%2BzWauoqyYpMK1ecWapaxlmJbDqrrGZp2apqNir6KvymakoqyS</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doug-pederson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-218819-html.html><span>←</span><span>Doug Pederson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
