Not only did she embarrass herself and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">get forcibly removed</a> from the RHOA reunion because of her fight, but she is quickly going broke. Once riding high with $16 million to her name, she is now worth only a fraction of that. Most celebrity net worth websites estimate she is barely worth $500,000, and some estimate that it is even less than that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Porsha Williams Was Abused by R Kelly</a></span></p><p>But while she may be down, the RHOA star is certainly not out. Porsha Williams has found bits of work here and there and if she keeps at the pace she is going she is likely to rekindle some of her wealth. She seems to have been humbled by her loss of wealth, as she is now an adamant activist in the modern-day civil rights movement. Here is what Porsha Williams has been up to lately, and how she might be rebuilding her net worth.</p><h2 id=porsha-williams-now-has-her-own-show-called-lsquo-porsha-rsquo-s-family-matters-rsquo><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Porsha Williams Now Has Her Own Show Called ‘Porsha’s Family Matters’</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After ten years on the show, Porsha left RHOA after the end of its 13th season in 2021 to star in a spin-off series called Porsha’s Family Matters. While she is financially struggling due to her divorce and fall from grace, she is very rich in love. Thanks to her story arc on RHOA, Porsha Williams now has a very loyal fan base that has followed her to her new show. The show is currently in the middle of its first season. Her fans also gave her over 6 million followers on Instagram, making her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most followed Real Housewives stars</a> ever. Williams recently gave her fans something to buy each other for Christmas, too.</p><h2 id=porsha-william-rsquo-s-memoir-lsquo-pursuit-of-porsha-rsquo-came-out-in-2021><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Porsha William’s Memoir ‘Pursuit Of Porsha’ Came Out In 2021</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her fans were delighted when Porsha announced she was writing a book and in 2021 she delivered on that announcement. The Pursuit of Porsha hit the shelves in November 2021 just in time for the Christmas shopping spree. The book is not at the top of the New York Times Bestseller list, but it seems to be doing respectably and it has a 4 out of 5 star average on Barnes and Noble’s website. At a recent book signing, <a href=#>an animal rights protester </a><a href=#>crashed the event demanding that Williams stop wearing fur</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Porsha Williams Dragged For Engagement To Former Co-Star's Husband</a></span></p><h2 id=porsha-williams-is-now-a-prominent-member-of-the-blm-movement><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Porsha Williams Is Now A Prominent Member of The BLM Movement</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Williams herself is a bit of a protester these days, even letting herself be arrested for the causes she supports. After the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a police officer on video, Williams became a vocal opponent of racial profiling and an advocate for Black Lives Matter and police reform. She was arrested at a protest outside of the Kentucky Attorney General’s home demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black EMT who was killed by police while sleeping in her bed. Taylor had no arrest warrant out nor was she the one the police were supposed to apprehend, and her death was appalling to several celebrities, including Williams. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> has called Porsha Williams “a crusader” against police violence for her work supporting the movement for Black Lives.</p><h2 id=porsha-williams-is-engaged-yet-again><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Porsha Williams Is Engaged, Yet Again</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A major cause of Williams' loss of net worth was her highly public divorce from NFL star Kordell Stewart. Williams went from $16 million to practically nothing overnight, even though salaries for Real Housewives stars average around $600k - $800k per season. However, love seems to continue to conquer all as <a href=#>she is now engaged to entrepreneur Simon Guobadia</a>. Previously, she had been briefly engaged to someone else, Dennis Mckinley, another entrepreneur.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Did Simon Guobadia Cheat With Porsha Williams?</a></span></p><h2 id=porsha-williams-rsquo-personal-net-worth-is-still-much-lower-than-what-it-used-to-be><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Porsha Williams’ Personal Net Worth Is Still Much Lower Than What It Used To Be</span></h2><p>Although residuals from her book sales have yet to kick in because it usually takes 3 - 6 months before an author sees any money, depending on their contract, and despite her new show, websites still estimate that Williams is only worth between $400k and $500k. However, Williams is engaged to a man who is worth $40 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-conclusion-she-is-still-broke-but-she-rsquo-s-on-the-right-track><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>In Conclusion, She Is Still Broke But She’s On The Right Track</span></h2><p>Williams may have hit a rough patch but she remains optimistic, as indicated by her book and the fact she has new projects on the horizon. She has stepped outside of the RHOA nest to start her show, tell her own story, and be her own person. While she had also been unlucky in love it seems her luck has turned around. Although, it’s important to remember that neither her previous marriage nor her previous engagement lasted very long. Will Williams make her money back? Perhaps, but whether she does or does not, it can’t be denied that she is not giving up.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Drama Surrounding Porsha Williams' Engagement</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinqKqjna5uw8ilo6KZnah6s7HApWShp6Wosri11Z6qZpmkoa6vwMBmpZ6sXay8s8DHZpmrp5uafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-jayron-kearse-related-to-jevon-kearse.html><span>←</span><span>Is Jayron Kearse related to Jevon Kearse?</span></a>
