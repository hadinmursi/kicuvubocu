The family has a long lineage of wrestlers. Most of the family has achieved success in the pro wrestling business.</p><p>One of the main reasons for the family to constantly be in the news in recent weeks is because of the upcoming Zac Efron-led film, <a href=#>The Iron Claw</a>. The movie is a biography of the Von Erich Family. The Current AEW World Heavyweight Champion <a href=#>MJF</a> also has a small role in the film as Lance Von Erich. The film is set to release on December 22.</p><p>Recently, Marshall Von Erich was on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Busted Open Radio</a> where he opened up about the film and how he and his family felt while watching the movie.</p><p>“It was nerve-wracking going into the premiere as a family. We all went over there — my sisters had a harder time, and my mom — there were just so many question marks. And my dad was like, ‘If anything, they’ll Google the real story, and I’ll talk to them.’ But we ended up watching it, and it’s based on a true story, so there’s a few chronological inconsistencies. But there was one part in the movie that my dad told us in confidence. I don’t think he ever told anybody in an interview or anything — of a dream he had after my uncle Kerry passed that was so heavy that we almost had to leave the movie theater. My dad was like — he couldn’t believe that it was in there,” Marshall Von Erich said.
