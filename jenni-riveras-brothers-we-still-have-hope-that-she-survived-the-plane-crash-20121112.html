"And we expect that there will be more in the future."</p><p>Rivera's other brothers, Pedro Jr., Gustavo, and Lupillo, echoed Juan's sentiments.</p><p>"We still have hope," Pedro Rivera Jr. said in <a href=#>an interview</a> about his sister. "[There's] a 95 percent chance that she is dead, but we believe. We have a strong belief in a powerful God that with five percent could do something, a miracle. And we have that belief because we don't have a body, we don't have DNA. They found clothes, they found shoes, but they did not find any DNA."</p><p>Pedro Jr., a pastor, noted that his brothers were set to travel to the crash site on Tuesday to survey the scene and search for answers.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"We just have that five percent that we're clinging to," he told a reporter. "But they are going there expecting the worst."</p><p>Rivera was one of seven passengers on a private jet that crashed south of Monterrey, Mexico, shortly after departing the city at 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 9. A spokesman for Mexico's civil aviation authority said there were no survivors at the site of the accident; destruction was so extensive that bodies could not yet be identified.</p><p>Born and raised in Long Beach, Calif., the singer gained fame for her popular renditions of regional Mexican music known as nortena and banda. During her career, she earned multiple Latin Grammy nominations and sold 15 million records. She is survived by her brothers, parents, and five children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtm6%2ByK%2Bcq5mjYq%2Bzu9OhnKurXayybr%2FToqOlZZiWw6Z5x6innmWkna61edKhnGarpafDqsLEnWStoJViva2tzZ5knKqRqLVufo9qaWppYWd8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-flatley-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jay Flatley Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
