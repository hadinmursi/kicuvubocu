The <i>Dancing With the Stars</i> pro showed off her incredible abs just one month after giving birth to her son, Maddox. “SUNDAY FUN DAY,” Holker wrote alongside a photo of&nbsp;herself in a tiny Triangl neoprene bikini, which put her rock-hard tummy on full display.</p><p>“I’ve been doing yoga since the week I got home from the hospital. I believe in having a sane mind, happy heart and healthy body,” Holker tells <i>Us Weekly</i>. “I was motivated to start doing yoga right after my labor to get my body back, but even more to meditate, and keep myself calm. I love being active and fit.”</p><p>She continued: “<span>I’m definitely paying attention to my body to make sure I don’t overwork myself, but walking Maddox around the block, yoga in my backyard and hiking are just enough.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>Holker and her husband, </span><b>Stephen “Twitch” Boss </b><span>(of <i>So You Think You Can Dance </i>fame), welcomed their baby boy in L.A. on March 27. She is also the mother of 7-year-old daughter Weslie from a previous relationship.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Us Weekly broke the news in October that the 28-year-old and Boss, 33, were expecting. Although she was pregnant, Holker stayed on<i> DWTS</i>‘ season 21 to compete with her celebrity partner, singer <b>Andy Grammer</b>. Holker’s doctor gave her the go-ahead to continue working — even if it meant doing backflips.</p><p>“I explained to her everything I have to do, and I asked if she thought I’d be OK,” Holker told <i>Us Weekly</i> in October. “She said, ‘Absolutely, your body is already used to you being this active.’ She was really confident about it and that made me feel so comfortable.”</p><p>The <i>High School Musical</i> alum, who follows a mostly gluten-, dairy-, soy- and oil-free diet, admitted she was worried about her body bouncing back. “I absolutely feel pressure to lose the baby weight quickly, but I don’t see that as a negative thing,” she revealed to <i>Fit Pregnancy</i> in February. “It’s great motivation so I can be physically fit, not just for myself but for my children as well.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaapJyewLC6jKGmpaOVp3qzu8KkqmaZXZe2rLXNomSoppViurC606Fkmp6kmr9us8ivoKefXZe2s8DHZq5raGRlgXJ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alano-miller-relationship-with-wife-dewanda-wise-690942-html.html><span>←</span><span>Alano Miller | Relationship With Wife DeWanda Wise</span></a>
