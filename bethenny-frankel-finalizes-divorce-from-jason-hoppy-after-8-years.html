This is an immensely painful and heartbreaking time for us.”</p><p>Frankel <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Hoppy in January 2013, and a contentious, <a href=#>years-long court battle</a> ensued.</p><p>“The divorce is <a href=#>taking a toll on her</a>,” a source close to the Skinnygirl founder exclusively told Us in June 2013. “She just wants what’s best for her daughter. She wants this divorce to be over and done with, but it’s being drawn out by Jason. All Bethenny wants to do is move on.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bethenny-Frankel-Finalizes-Divorce-From-Jason-Hoppy-8-Years-After-Split-02.jpg><p>The primary issue between the pair involved how they would share custody of Bryn, now 10. Then, in January 2017, the businessman was <a href=#>arrested for allegedly stalking and harassing Frankel</a>, which further delayed the case. He denied the accusations before <a href=#>accepting a plea deal</a> that October, in which he agreed to abide by a six-month stay-away order in exchange for the case’s dismissal.</p><p>The reality star and Hoppy <a href=#>faced each other in court</a> in March 2019, where they continued to lodge accusations against one another and both <a href=#>broke down in tears</a> before the judge. Despite multiple hearings, they still were unable to finalize their divorce at the time, with Frankel confirming on&nbsp;<i>Watch What&nbsp;Happens Live With Andy Cohen</i> in January 2020, “I’m <a href=#>still married</a>.”</p><p>The news of the BStrong founder’s divorce finalization comes amid rumors that she is <a href=#>engaged to movie producer <strong>Paul Bernon</strong></a>, whom she has <a href=#>dated on and off</a> since October 2018. During a trip to Florida earlier this month, she was photographed wearing a massive diamond ring on her left hand. She has not addressed the speculation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnaSdsq%2B62Gadq5meoLKtecWipZqkma%2BytHnDoq2oqpOaeqe%2BzqZko5mjpLtutM6pp7JlkZvBpr6McWSynZGnwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./austin-st-john-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-302542-html.html><span>←</span><span>Austin St John Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
