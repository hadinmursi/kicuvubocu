(The acclaimed actor was even sentenced to three years in jail back in 1999.)</span></p><p>“Unfortunately there’s a genetic component to addiction and Indio has likely inherited it,” the actor said in a statement to <i>Us Weekly</i> at the time. (Indio’s mother is singer <b>Deborah Falconer</b>.)</p><p>“There is a lot of family support and understanding, and we’re all determined to rally behind him and help him become the man he’s capable of being,” he continued. “We’re grateful to the Sheriff’s department for their intervention, and believe Indio can be another recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale.”</p><p>Downey Jr. is also the father of son Exton Elias Downey and daughter Avri Roel Downey.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Kav7V5w6iup52pYrezec6pnKerXaq9bq3BqKytZZiewG6%2FzqeqZqukp8Kos8ueZLChpJ16orDDopqtoZ%2Bjerh9lXBna2xf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pooja-sawant-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-356506-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pooja Sawant Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
