Ultimately, they acknowledged her death with a still picture right before the divas match at around 10:20EST or so. They made a tribute video in honor, which is currently on WWE.com, but they didn’t bother to air it on television last night.</p><p>Former WWE Diva Amy Zidian is continuing her wrestling career as she is scheduled to work for Women Extreme Wrestling on July 12, 2007 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She recently updated her MySpace page (myspace.com/amymariezidian) with a message saying that she’s continuing her wrestling training at the Dory Funk Conservatory in Ocala, Florida. She also acknowledges her departure from WWE last December. Zidian said, “Hey Everyone, being released from WWE was really hard on me. I was inexperienced and very new to wrestling. Boy, should I have known who some people were at the time!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpBxbW5tXZeupLfSrZignV2gsre1zWabrqaep664ec2erqxlkaLGbsbInaCapl2ivLOx</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelorettes-gabby-windey-didnt-tell-erich-schwer-about-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelorettes Gabby Windey Didn't Tell Erich Schwer About Girlfriend</span></a>
