Speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestleZone’s&nbsp;Ella Jay</a>, Jade explained the origins of her distinct social media handle.</p><p>“Kind of going back to ‘local emo girlfriend,’ it’s — I don’t want to say emo band. It was back when metalcore was really a top genre in the alternative music scene. And I really resonated with this band, Issues before they were canceled. I really was into Issues. They called their fans ‘Hooligans’ and they had a song called Sad Ghost and that happened to be my favorite song. I was late on the Instagram train, and I didn’t know what to make my handle so ‘Sad Hooligan’ just came about from that little metalcore band. And I guess it kind of fit still, a little bit.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 id=h-motionless-in-white>Motionless In White</h3><p>Later in the interview, Jade revealed her favorite band in the metalcore genre — a band she’s seen 26 times in concert so far. Soon, Jade will raise that number to 27.</p><p>“The band that I have seen the most amount of times is Motionless In White. I think I’ve lost [count]. I have a track in my phone, I think we’re coming up on I’m seeing them for the 27th time. I’ve followed this band since the beginning of time, back from when they had like 20 people in the crowd and now they’re doing sold out shows all across the world. I’m just like ‘my babies.’ Anytime I meet them, they’re just like, ‘Oh my God, hey Brittany.’ They’re so sweet and I love them,” Jade said.</p><p>“I go back every time because they’re huge Halloween enthusiasts and they tour each October. They do like a big Halloween show, so that is what I’m doing in October. I obviously have to see my favorite band. Motionless in White is definitely my favorite band in such a great, great, great, great, great live artist, but I think my favorite concerts live is A Day to Remember.”</p><p>Outside of the metalcore genre, Jade is also a fan of pop and country music, with Taylor Swift reigning supreme as a notable favorite.</p><p><a href=#>Brittany Jade Is An OG Swiftie, Wants To Punch ‘Tell Me Why’ Critics In The Throat</a></p><p>Watch our full interview with Brittany Jade below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZqKmpJq%2Ft7XEsKpoaWRlhXl8kGaZq6Gkqa6vxYyjmJ2dXZrFsbjAoqWsZaSdsm670aKeoqajYryneceeqWarkZl6qbvOpaCgmZ5iurC6yKScqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blac-chynas-engagement-ring-looks-just-like-kim-ks-w201504.html><span>←</span><span>Blac Chyna's Engagement Ring Looks Just Like Kim K.'s</span></a>
