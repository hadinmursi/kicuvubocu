As Kate, 42, recovered in private, Kensington Palace confirmed that she would be halting her public duties until after Easter in late March, but her absence prompted a slew of conspiracy theories about her whereabouts.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>WATCH: A remorseful <a href=#>@StephenAtHome</a> on his The Late Show following his recent jokes about the Princess of Wales and the rumours about her disappearance and marriage.<br>“I tell a lot of jokes” he says but wishes Kate a “swift and thorough” recovery 👇 <a href=#>@colbertlateshow</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ksZ3DU2ccx</a></p><p>— Chris Ship (@chrisshipitv) <a href=#>March 26, 2024</a></p><p>The speculation reached a fever pitch earlier this month when William, 41, and Kate released a photo of the Princess of Wales with their three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5, in honor of U.K. Mother’s Day, which was later <a href=#>discovered to be digitally altered</a>. (Kate later revealed she has been <a href=#>diagnosed with cancer</a>.)</p><p>Amid the drama, Colbert, 59, <a href=#>dredged up rumors</a> that William had been unfaithful with Hanbury, 40.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Stephen-Colbert-Reacts-to-Rose-Hanbury-Legal-Notice-Over-Prince-William-Affair-Joke-02.jpg><p>“Internet sleuths are guessing that Kate’s absence may be related to her husband, and the future king of England, William, <a href=#>having an affair</a>,” Colbert said during the March 12 episode of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “I think we all know who the alleged other woman is, say it with me, the Marchioness of Cholmondeley. Now there have been rumors of an affair between William and [Rose] since 2019. According to tabloids, back then, when Kate supposedly confronted him about it, he ‘laughed it off, saying there was nothing to it.’ Aha, always a good response when your wife accuses you of cheating.”</p><p>Colbert explained that Hanbury is “an old friend of the royals” who is married to “a close friend of William’s” named <a href=#><strong>David Rocksavage</strong></a>.</p><p>“Really? Rocksavage? That sounds less like a British noble and more like a musician from The Flintstones,” he quipped.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Stephen-Colbert-Reacts-to-Rose-Hanbury-Legal-Notice-Over-Prince-William-Affair-Joke-01.jpg><p>Colbert’s joke brought the affair allegations back into the spotlight, leading Hanbury’s lawyers to <a href=#>deny the rumors</a> in a statement to Business Insider. Her attorneys also <a href=#>sent a legal notice</a> to the late-night show.</p><p>“The rumor appears to have entered into the mainstream media recently as a result of another joke made about it on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” Hanbury’s lawyers said in a statement. “We have written on our client’s behalf to CBS and various other reputable media organizations to confirm that the allegation is false.”</p><p>William and Kate have never addressed the infidelity speculation, but a source told Us Weekly in 2019 that it impacted the couple’s dynamic. “Kate <a href=#>finds the rumors hurtful</a>, obviously, and hates the thought that one day her children will be able to read about them online,” the insider said at the time. “It forced her and William to sit back and examine their relationship, which they realized they should have been doing more often.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWltaa6jJympZqVp8FurcOdqZ6ro5rAbr%2FKoqtmqJ%2Bgtq%2BzjJ%2Bsp2WRqXqsrdOeZKahlJm5psDOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebs-sexiest-bikini-selfies-from-twitter-and-instagram-2014243.html><span>←</span><span>Stars' Sexiest Bikini Selfies | Us Weekly</span></a>
