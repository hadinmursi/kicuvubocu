In the other photo included, the pair were dressed up while Clark touched his wife’s baby bump.</p><p>The <i>Off With My Head </i>author also gave her fans a sneak peak of the pregnancy on her Instagram story. She <a href=#>showed off her bare bump</a> in the bathroom mirror, <a href=#>while sharing that the baby news</a> was actually first announced on the couple’s joint podcast, “The Good the Bad the Baby.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/stassi-schroeder-beau-clarks-relationship-timeline-sept-2023-01.jpg><p>“We had to come here first because we had to tell y’all first,” she said in a clip from the episode.</p><p>Less than two weeks after the announcement, she also <a href=#>revealed the sex of the baby</a> on the podcast. “I knew the whole entire time that we were having a boy,” Schroeder told her listeners. “I kept saying it. I felt it. It was a vibe. … I don’t know how to f–king explain it.”</p><p>Shortly after, <a href=#>she exclusively spoke to </a>Us Weekly about her expanding family. “It is my fantasy to have a s—t ton of children, a lot of them,” Schroeder said. “But children are really expensive. I’m discovering as life goes on — they’re very expensive and I feel like they’re the most time-consuming thing in the entire world.”</p><p>When asked whether they will have baby No. 3, she responded: “When I think about what I want my children’s lives to be like, I want to be able to devote so much attention to each of them and give them as much as possible. I’m like, ‘If I had a third, how would I give that one as much attention as these other two?’ So at this point, I feel like two is a great number for me, but never say never because I might wake up one day and decide today’s the day. You never know.”</p><p>In the same month of her pregnancy announcement, the New Orleans native revealed she is going back on tour for Straight Up With Stassi Live, featuring Clark and <strong>Taylor Strecker</strong>.</p><p>“It’s been 3 years since we last toured and we’re FINALLY hitting the road again!! Needless to say, there’s lots to catch up on,” <a href=#>she wrote via Instagram</a>. “PS I already have 4 different sparkly bump-friendly OOTDs ready to go ✨”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/stassi-schroeder-beau-clarks-relationship-timeline-sept-2023-03.jpg><p>When speaking to Us, the podcaster detailed her thought process behind being pregnant while on tour. “I was actually putting off trying to get pregnant because I wanted to go on tour. I was like, ‘OK, 2022 spring, we’re gonna finally have our wedding [and] spring 2023, let’s plan for the tour.’ And then I thought to myself, ‘Well, I really wanna get pregnant, but I can’t go on tour and not have Aperol spritzes,’” she said. “[But] then I had this moment where I realized that being pregnant [and] having another kid is what I want more than anything in the world, more than going on tour.”</p><p><a href=#>The Bravo alum</a> continued: “And so I was like, ‘Actually, this is gonna be really fun,’ because I feel like I’ll be way more focused, I’ll be way more motivated and there’s something that, like, happens when I get pregnant where I just feel like I want to do more, more, more, more. So, I just feel like this is gonna be a completely different experience than what it was like the first time I went on tour.”</p><p>Less than a year before sharing their baby news, Schroeder and Clark <a href=#>celebrated their second wedding in Italy</a>. Although <a href=#>they initially tied the knot</a> in September 2020 in a backyard ceremony, the twosome waited until COVID-19 restrictions were lifted to throw a bigger party.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The TV personality became a mom in January 2021 when Hartford was born, but she always knew motherhood was in her future.</p><p>“I’m ready to have a baby,” she exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i> in June 2019. “I’ve never really been someone that’s, like, dreamt about her wedding … but I always knew that I wanted to be a mom. So I feel like I’m in a place in my life where I make my own decisions and forge my own path. I know I want to be a mom, so I would rather get knocked up before I waited to have a wedding.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasrJGowKp50pyfq6eVmbKzecairZ6rXZe2s8DHZquoZZKWr7p5zahka2WnnsGpecGemK5lk6Gus7eO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sofia-vergara-why-didnt-want-kids-joe-manganiello.html><span>←</span><span>Sofia Vergara Reveals Why She Didn't Want Kids With Joe Manganiello</span></a>
