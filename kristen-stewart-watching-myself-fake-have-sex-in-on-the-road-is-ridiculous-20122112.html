The 22-year-old actress’ latest film, On the Road, arrives in limited theaters Friday, Dec. 21, and it’s a big departure from her Twilight days. Stewart stars at the promiscuous Marylou, the 16-year-old wife of Dean Moriarty (Garrett Hedlund) in the Walter Salles adaptation of Jack Kerouac’s classic beat generation novel.
But Stewart insists that her sex scenes in the film with Kirsten Dunst‘s real-life boyfriend Hedlund, 28, didn’t intimidate her — it was their dancing scene that did."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Stewart stars at the promiscuous Marylou, the 16-year-old wife of Dean Moriarty (<strong>Garrett Hedlund</strong>) in the Walter Salles adaptation of Jack Kerouac’s classic beat generation novel.</p><p>But Stewart insists that her sex scenes in the film with <a href=#><strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong></a>‘s real-life boyfriend Hedlund, 28, didn’t intimidate her — it was their dancing scene that did.</p><p>“The dancing scene was so much more terrifying than any of the sex scenes were for me. I was so scared of it,” she explains in a new interview with <a href=#>IndieWire</a>. “We crammed, I think, 60 extras into a tiny little room. Literally, I could feel the floor vibrating. It was so f–king cool. But I was terrified.”</p><p>When asked what it’s like watching herself have sex on screen, Stewart says, “Well, I wasn’t really having sex.”</p><p>“To be honest, I think if you were to isolate the scenes, it’s fairly ridiculous watching yourself fake have sex,” she added. “But within the movie, watching the movie, I do get so caught up in this one. I’ve seen it three times, and that’s not typical for me.”</p><p>Stewart is also looking forward to watching herself in the sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="kristen stewart" width=467 height=387 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Though she said she’s not allowed to talk about it, Stewart shared, “It’s gonna be f–kin’ amazing. No, I’m so excited about it, it’s crazy.”</p><p>But she added, “The other day I said that there was a strong possibility that we’re going to make a sequel, and that’s very true, but everyone was like, ‘Whoa, stop talking about it.’ So no, I’m totally not allowed to talk about it.”</p><p>Despite the <a href=#>controversy</a> surrounding the first Snow White film (Stewart was <a href=#>caught cheating with her married director</a>, <strong>Rupert Sanders</strong>, in July), the actress is completely on board to film the proposed sequel, and loves the plot suggestions (that she’s not allowed to discuss.)</p><p>“Oh my God. F–k, yeah. Absolutely,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In August, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reported that one plot option being discussed was a spinoff starring<strong> <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a></strong>, reprising his role as the Huntsman. And it is still unknown if the rumored sequel will be directed again by Sanders.</p><p>Another project Stewart has in the works is Warner Bros.’s Focus, a story about two con-artists who fall in love. The actress was set to share steamy love scenes with costar <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, but the actor’s rep confirmed to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> Dec. 20 that Affleck has dropped out of the film due to “scheduling conflicts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaa6jKyrnq%2BRp8Fuw8CtmqGhnpx6rsXSnqOfZZaWuKZ5x5qtnmWjmsVutc1mpqdlpJ2ybr7OmptmoaNiv6qwyJyspaelqHpzfJBraWppYmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-reveals-favorite-sex-position-that-she-pees-her-spanx-2015102.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Reveals Favorite Sex Position, That She Pees Her Spanx</span></a>
