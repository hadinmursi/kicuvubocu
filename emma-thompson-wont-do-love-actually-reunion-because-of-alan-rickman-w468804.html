Karen, who found the piece of jewelry before it was wrapped, figured out that he gave it to another woman when she opened her present, a Joni Mitchell album.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Back in 2015, Curtis’s wife, Emma Freud, tweeted what happened to the couple following the affair.
