Additional details related to DOUBLE OR NOTHING, which was initially scheduled to be held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in&nbsp;Las Vegas, will be revealed in the weeks ahead with features of the event itself ultimately being determined by the latest guidance of national and global health authorities.</span></p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">The highly anticipated event will be available for purchase via iN DEMAND cable operators, DirecTV, DISH&nbsp;</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Network and B/R Live.

This comes after Hancock sent a direct message to the hotel on Twitter, asking whether or not the event was still planned for its May 23, 2020 date.&nbsp;This comes after a report last week that MGM Resorts had closed all shows and attractions through May 31.</p><p>However, the news that the event will reportedly be rescheduled until 2021 is a bit of a shock, although no official announcement from either MGM or All Elite Wrestling has been made. In the meantime, it seems as if it’s safe to assume that Double or Nothing will not be happening in May.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just in case you were still holding out hope that Double or Nothing was still happening in Las Vegas on Memorial Day weekend, this is the DM I just received from <a href=#>@MGMGrand</a>…<a href=#>#AEW</a> <a href=#>#AEWDoN</a> <a href=#>#AEWDynamite</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Jj82MyjIw4</a></p><p>— Dave Hancock (@dhancock110) <a href=#>April 14, 2020</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBxaWlqYGK6qLmMoKmappRiwKLF0maYnq9dmby2rsueZKiqXaO8tbTIp55moaNiv6a%2FwqGcna2cmrFuss6rZGtoYmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-letter-to-my-future-daughters-best-friend-by-dan-fitzpatrick-html.html><span>←</span><span>A Letter to My Future Daughters Best Friend, by Dan Fitzpatrick</span></a>
