"LAPD’s SWAT officers responded to the location and discovered two victims inside the apartment suffering from gunshot wounds. The initial investigation revealed that 34-year-old Earl Warren Hayes shot his wife, 30-year-old Stephanie Elyse Moseley to death and then took his own life. The Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics responded to the scene and pronounced both Mr. Hayes and Ms. Moseley dead at the scene."</p><p><strong>Moseley</strong>, a dancer and actress featured on VH1's drama series Hit the Floor, was reported dead Monday after a suspected murder-suicide involving <strong>Hayes</strong>.</p><p>Multiple outlets reported Monday, Dec. 8, that residents heard shots ring out in the early hours of the morning from inside a swanky L.A. apartment complex. Authorities including the SWAT team rushed to the scene and discovered two people dead from bullet wounds.</p><p>According to local CW affiliate <a href=#>KTLA</a>, Moseley and Hayes were identified by<strong> Burrel Wilks</strong>, a close friend and self-described "life coach" of Hayes. According to Wilks, <a href=#>the two were married</a>.</p><p>Police were called to the scene at about 7:30 a.m., after up to 10 gunshots and a woman's screams were heard by a resident, the Los Angeles Police Department said. Law enforcement sources told&nbsp;<a href=#>TMZ</a> that Hayes shot Moseley, then turned the gun on himself.</p><p>Along with starring as Arelly on the VH1 drama series, Moseley has appeared in movies like 2012's Mirror Mirror and 2011's The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1. She also had a small role as Porsche in the 2015 film The Best Thanksgiving Ever.</p><p>Moseley's true passion, however, was as a dancer. Her talent has allowed her to work with numerous high-profile singers including <strong><a href=#>Britney Spears</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Chris Brown</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Pharrell&nbsp;Williams</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Beyonce</a></strong>.</p><p><a href=#>Along with many other celebrities</a>, Brown shared an old photo with Moseley on Monday mourning her passing. "RIP baby girl," the "Forever" singer wrote. "Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the age of 17, Moseley — a Vancouver native — moved to Japan, where her career began. "I've been on tour since I was a child," she said <a href=#>in a 2013 interview</a> with VH1. "I just made a decision to myself that I wanted to be in the front."</p><p>As for her gig on Hit the Floor? "Everybody works out, everybody’s focused, everybody wants to do better," she gushed of her costars. "Everybody wants to be harder. It’s like this morale and this energy between all of us that is magical." The second season of Hit the Floor wrapped this past August. Ten new episodes of the third season have been slated for a May 2015 premiere.</p><p>Hayes was previously signed to <strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong>'s record label. Last month, Hayes <a href=#>posted a photo</a> at a Lakers game with Mayweather, <strong>Fabolous,</strong> and <strong>The Game</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavoGFisaK6wp6pZqukmr2prc2inGaln6iyrbHYZpuemZRirqfAxKtkpq2imbKzedKuoJyhlJp6c3yQbW9qal8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./valerie-c-robinson-bio-wiki-age-family-husband-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Valerie C.
