Pipkins said he was in the best shape of his life and added, “The biggest difference has been my weight, and the way my body’s come together. I came in at 30 percent body fat, now I’m down to 24 percent, my weight’s at 315 and I’m running to the ball.” Through the first two games of the 2013 season, Pipkins registered two tackles before tearing his ACL and sitting out the rest of the season.
