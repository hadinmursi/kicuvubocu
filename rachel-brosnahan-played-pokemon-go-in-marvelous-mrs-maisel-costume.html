It’s kind of a core memory [being] decked out in full<i> Mrs. Maisel </i>gear with one of our security team guys.”</p><p class=p1>Brosnahan <a href=#>starred as Miriam “Midge” Maisel</a> on Prime Video’s <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel </i>between 2017 and 2023. While Brosnahan’s titular role meant that she was frequently on-camera, she did have some downtime between takes.</p><p class=p1>“The thing about set life, it’s a lot of hurry up and wait,” she explained to <i>Us. </i>“So, you know, you’re going, going, going, going, going, but then between set-ups or there might be a small scene that you’re not in [when] there’s not a whole lot to do.”</p><p class=p1>While Brosnahan partially used her downtime to “read a book” or “learn lines” for upcoming scenes, Pokémon Go became a “nice way [for her] to pass the time.” Niantic released its augmented reality mobile game in 2016, where fans could attempt to “catch” Pokémon creatures in the real world through an app.</p><p class=p1>“It’s a different kind of to-do list as a serial checklist person. I love checking off [and] catching different Pokémon,” Brosnahan said on Saturday. “There are different tasks you can complete. I felt like it was a fun way to pass the time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Rachel-Brosnahan-Played-Pokemon-Go-in-Marvelous-Mrs-Maisel-Costume-02-2024.jpg><p class=p1>Brosnahan brought her Pokémon-hunting expertise to the annual <a href=# rel=noopener>Pokémon Go Fest</a>, which is described as the “biggest Pokémon Go event of the year.” The festival — which takes place between Friday, July 5, and Sunday, July 7 — allows budding trainers to access exclusive gameplay and special bonuses while meeting other players in person.</p><p class=p1>“One of the things that [is] fun about it, especially in the early days, you had to work with other people to progress in the game,” Brosnahan, who has been playing Pokémon Go since 2016, said. “It was a fun way to meet people in different parts of the world. I don’t think I would have met any of the people I ended up playing with.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She added, “There was a family I met in Vancouver when I was out there while <a href=#>my husband</a> [<strong>Jason Ralph</strong>] was working. They traveled together in a large pack to fight Pokémon and battle in raids together. It was generations of a family that I had the opportunity to meet and I don’t think we would have, if not for the game.”</p><p class=p1>The actress further noted that her game allies had no idea who she was, which she called “the best part” of the experience.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Andrew Nodell</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmZOdsq15waumrKaRna6vec%2BlmLKdlGK9sLfEpqanZZekeqq6jKaYq66Voby2v4ymqaxlnZa2tLHLZpqoq6SquqZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscars-2023-everything-to-know-about-the-academy-awards.html><span>←</span><span>Oscars 2023: Everything to Know About the Academy Awards</span></a>
