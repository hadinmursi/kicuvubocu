A handful of the pieces in the line are made out of chiffon, which is eco-freindly and biodegradable.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Working with Hailee has been such an amazing experience. She really wanted to build this collection around of her love for vintage ‘70s style prints, colors and silhouettes, so we took that and created from there,” <strong>Francesca Aiello</strong>, Founder and Creative Director of Frankies Bikinis, tells <i>Stylish</i>. “She was extremely hands on throughout the entire design and creation process, every idea that she brought to the table was innovative and creative, and this led to the collection of amazing pieces you are seeing today!”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The collection, which ranges in price from $90 to $175, will be released in two separate drops.
