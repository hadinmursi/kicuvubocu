She is all over the map trying to figure out what she wants to do in life.”</p><p>In fact, Dannielynn is currently “convinced she is going to marry <a href=#><strong>Adam Driver</strong></a>,” Birkhead joked with Us.</p><p>“She is extremely upset with <a href=#><strong>Joaquin Phoenix</strong></a> after he ‘robbed’ Adam of his Golden Globe and consoled herself while eating a whole chocolate cake watching the Golden Globes,” he said. “Now she’s looking forward to the Oscars and she watched the live presentation of the nomination announcements. She said, ‘The Joker better back off, this award is going to be all Adam’s!’” (The Girls alum, 36, is nominated for his role in Netflix’s <a href=#>Marriage Story</a> alongside <a href=#><strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong></a>.)</p><p>Smith gave birth to Dannielynn in 2006, five months before dying of an overdose at age 39. Lifetime’s Hopelessly in Love docuseries is giving Birkhead the chance to tell his side of his love story with the late model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Larry-Birkhead-Says-His-Anna-Nicole-Smiths-Daughter-Has-Theater-Bug-2.jpg><p>“People think it was like a one-night stand that I had with Anna and then I got lucky and won this DNA lottery, when <a href=#>it was, like, a two-year relationship</a> with, admittedly, highs and lows,” he told Us on Monday. “But it was a crazy love story.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hopelessly in Love: Anna Nicole Smith and Larry Birkhead</a>&nbsp;airs on Lifetime Friday, January 17, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Lexi Ciccone</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalmaKnxm6uyKuioZ2RmXqius2aZKehk6S5pnnSpqCtoKNisaLBxqGrnqpdmK62s8etZK2glZbBpr6Mm6ygZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kourtney-kardashian-led-light-therapy-mask-skincare.html><span>←</span><span>Kourtney Kardashian LED Therapy Mask: Get a Similar 1 for $35</span></a>
