Throughout UFC history, it's very rare for a fighter to miss weight for a title bout, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Most recently at UFC 274, Charles Oliveira missed weight for his lightweight bout with Justin Gaethje.

What is forgotten is that the Hall of Famer should've had an additional title defense on the books. That being his victory over Joe Riggs at UFC 56.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was the first time in UFC history that a fighter missed weight for a title bout. Riggs missed weight by 2.5 pounds, but the bout was allowed to go ahead as a non-title affair. After losing to the scale, Riggs went on to lose to Hughes via first-round submission.</p><h2 id=anderson-silva-vs-travis-lutter-ufc-67><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Anderson Silva vs. Travis Lutter (UFC 67)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Travis-Lutter-1.jpg><p>Matt Serra made history on The Ultimate Fighter season four. After winning the welterweight tournament, he went on to shock the world with a first-round <a href=#>knockout of Georges St-Pierre</a>. The winner of the other tournament that season was Travis Lutter.

After defeating Charles Oliveira, he was given an interim title fight with Max Holloway at UFC 206. Sadly for Showtime, the title fight went ahead as one for only Holloway, as he missed weight by three pounds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The interim title fight was <a href=#>dominated by Holloway</a>.

However, when the champion pulled out on three weeks' notice, the bout was turned into an interim championship bout. Stepping in on short notice was Yoel Romero, who was fresh off a loss to Whittaker.</p><p>Romero's short notice likely played a role as he badly missed weight. The Cuban missed weight by 2.7 pounds but was able to turn around his fortunes on fight day. After going down two rounds, Romero blasted Rockhold out in the third round to secure a huge win.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-whittaker-vs-yoel-romero-ufc-225><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Robert Whittaker vs. Yoel Romero (UFC 225)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Whittaker-Romero-UFC-213.jpg><p>Yoel Romero is the only fighter to ever miss weight for a UFC title bout on two different occasions.
