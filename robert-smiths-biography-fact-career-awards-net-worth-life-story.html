He was a member of <i>The Crawley Boat</i> band along with his brother, sister and friends. Prior to this, he formed <i>The Obelisk,</i> which later became <i>The Cure</i>. The band had several names and line ups that played at school functions. <i>The Cure</i> was formed in the late seventies as <i>The Easy </i>Cure, comprising along with Robert, Michael Dempsey, Lol Tolhurst and Porl Thompson.</p><p>Smith never intended to be the lead singer, but took the position when the original vocalist left the group. He is also the guitarist and sometimes songwriter for the band. These include&nbsp;<i>The Love Cats,</i> which was the band’s first top ten hit, <i>Let’s Go To Bed,</i> and <i>The Walk</i>.</p><p>Smith is the only band member to have been with the group since its founding. His trademark is smeared red lipstick, black eye liner, and unkempt hair. He also plays the guitar for rock bands <i>Siouxise</i> and the <i>Banshees</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqfl7KzwIyspKKsmKh6o7XOoKmaqJiueqetwq1knJmimrKzecCwmKuco2K7psCMsKarrJhiuaqyxGaqraeirnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rihanna-denies-pregnancy-rumors-fenty-campaign.html><span>←</span><span>Rihanna Denies Pregnancy Rumors With Risqu Fenty Campaign</span></a>
